There are lots and lots of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a Data Scientist, we will constantly need to write own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. The art of function writing is what we will learn in this first Python Data Science toolbox course. We will write our very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. We will gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in our very own function writing practice. On top of this, we will wrap up each topic by diving into using your acquired skills to write functions that analyze twitter DataFrames and are generalizable to broader Data Science contexts.

## Write a Simple Function
Function bodies need to be indented by a consistent number of spaces and the choice of 4 is common.

```python
# Define the function shout
def shout():
    """Print a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word= 'congratulations'+'!!!'

    # Print shout_word
    print(shout_word)

# Call shout
shout()
```

### Single-parameter functions
You have successfully defined and called your own function! That's pretty cool. We defined and called the function shout(), which printed out a string concatenated with '!!!'. We will now update shout() by adding a parameter so that it can accept and process any string argument passed to it. Also note that shout(word), the part of the header that specifies the function name and parameter(s), is known as the signature of the function. You may encounter this term in the wild!

```python
# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Print a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = word + '!!!'

    # Print shout_word
    print(shout_word)
# Call shout with the string 'congratulations'
shout('congratulations')
```

### Functions that return single values
Now we try our hand at another modification to the shout() function so that it now returns a single value instead of printing within the function. Recall that the return keyword lets us return values from functions. Returning values is generally more desirable than printing them out because, as we saw earlier, a print() call assigned to a variable has type NoneType.

```python
# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Return a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word= word+'!!!'

    # Replace print with return
    return(shout_word)

# Pass 'congratulations' to shout: yell
yell=shout('congratulations')

# Print yell
print(yell)
```

### Functions with Multiple Parameters
We are now going to use what we have learned to modify the shout() function further. Here, we will modify shout() to accept two arguments.

```python
# Define shout with parameters word1 and word2
def shout(word1, word2):
    """Concatenate strings with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + "!!!"

    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + '!!!'

    # Concatenate shout1 with shout2: new_shout
    new_shout = shout1 + shout2

    # Return new_shout
    return new_shout

# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout(): yell
yell = shout('congratulations', 'you')

# Print yell
print(yell)
```

## Tuples
A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In some ways a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects and repetition but a tuple is immutable unlike lists which are mutable. Here, we will practice how to construct, unpack, and access tuple elements.

```python
nums = (2, 4, 6)
# Unpack nums into num1, num2, and num3
num1 = nums[0]
num2 = nums[1]
num3 = nums[2]

# Construct even_nums
even_nums = (2, num2, num3)
```

### Functions that Return Multiple Values
In the previous exercise, we constructed tuples, assigned tuples to variables, and unpacked tuples. Here we will return multiple values from a function using tuples. Let's now update our shout() function to return multiple values. Instead of returning just one string, we will return two strings with the string !!! concatenated to each. Note that the return statement return x, y has the same result as return (x, y): the former actually packs x and y into a tuple under the hood!

```python
# Define shout_all with parameters word1 and word2
def shout_all(word1,word2):
        # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1= word1+'!!!'
        # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2= word2+'!!!'
        # Construct a tuple with shout1 and shout2: shout_words
    shout_words=(shout1,shout2)
    # Return shout_words
    return shout_words
# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout_all(): yell1, yell2
yell1, yell2 = shout_all('congratulations','you')
# Print yell1 and yell2
print(yell1)
print(yell2)
```

We've got our first taste of writing your own functions in the previous exercises. We've learned how to add parameters to our own function definitions, return a value or multiple values with tuples, and how to call the functions we've defined. Now we will bring together all these concepts and apply them to a simple data science problem. We will load a dataset and develop functionalities to extract simple insights from the data. Goal is to recall how to load a dataset into a DataFrame. The dataset contains Twitter data and we will iterate over entries in a column to build a dictionary in which the keys are the names of languages and the values are the number of tweets in the given language.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Import Twitter data as dataframe: df
df = pd.read_csv('tweets.csv')
# Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
langs_count = {}
# Extract column from DataFrame: col
col = df['lang']

# Iterate over lang column in df
for entry in col:
    # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
    if entry in langs_count.keys():
        langs_count[entry]+=1
    # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
    else:
        langs_count[entry]= 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(langs_count)
```
Great job! We've now defined the functionality for iterating over entries in a column and building a dictionary with keys the names of languages and values the number of tweets in the given language. Now we will define a function with the functionality you developed in the previous exercise, return the resulting dictionary from within the function, and call the function with the appropriate arguments.

```python
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df,col_name):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""
    # Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
    langs_count = {}  
    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]
        # Iterate over lang column in dataframe
    for entry in col:
        # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
        if entry in langs_count.keys():
            langs_count[entry]+=1
        # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            langs_count[entry]=1
    # Return the langs_count dictionary
    return langs_count
# Call count_entries(): result
result=count_entries(tweets_df,'lang')
# Print the result
print(result)
```

## The keyword global
We will use the keyword global within a function to alter the value of a variable defined in the global scope.

```python
# Create a string: team
team = "teen titans"
# Define change_team()
def change_team():
    """Change the value of the global variable team."""
    # Use team in global scope
    global team
    # Change the value of team in global: team
    team = "justice league"
# Print team
print(team)
# Call change_team()
change_team()
# Print team
print(team)
```

## Nested Functions
One reason why we would like to use nested functions is to avoid writing out the same computations within functions repeatedly. There's nothing new about defining nested functions: you simply define it as you would a regular function with def and embed it inside another function!

In this exercise, inside a function three_shouts(), we will define a nested function inner() that concatenates a string object with !!!. three_shouts() then returns a tuple of three elements, each a string concatenated with !!! using inner().

```python
# Define three_shouts
def three_shouts(word1, word2, word3):
    """Returns a tuple of strings
    concatenated with '!!!'."""

    # Define inner
    def inner(word):
        """Returns a string concatenated with '!!!'."""
        return word + '!!!'

    # Return a tuple of strings
    return (inner(word1),inner(word2), inner(word3))

# Call three_shouts() and print
print(three_shouts('a', 'b', 'c'))
```

Great job, we have just nested a function within another function. One other pretty cool reason for nesting functions is the idea of a closure. This means that the nested or inner function remembers the state of its enclosing scope when called. Thus, anything defined locally in the enclosing scope is available to the inner function even when the outer function has finished execution.

Let's move forward then! Here you will complete the definition of the inner function inner_echo() and then call echo() a couple of times, each with a different argument. Complete the exercise and see what the output will be!

```python
# Define echo
def echo(n):
    """Return the inner_echo function."""

    # Define inner_echo
    def inner_echo(word1):
        """Concatenate n copies of word1."""
        echo_word = word1 * n
        return echo_word

    # Return inner_echo
    return inner_echo

# Call echo: twice
twice = echo(2)

# Call echo: thrice
thrice = echo(3)

# Call twice() and thrice() then print
print(twice('hello'), thrice('hello'))
```

### The keyword nonlocal and nested functions
Let's once again work further on your mastery of scope! In this exercise, you will use the keyword nonlocal within a nested function to alter the value of a variable defined in the enclosing scope.

```python
# Define echo_shout()
def echo_shout(word):
    """Change the value of a nonlocal variable"""
        # Concatenate word with itself: echo_word
    echo_word=word+word
        #Print echo_word
    print(echo_word)
        # Define inner function shout()
    def shout():
        """Alter a variable in the enclosing scope"""    
        #Use echo_word in nonlocal scope
        nonlocal echo_word
        #Change echo_word to echo_word concatenated with '!!!'
        echo_word = echo_word+'!!!'
    # Call function shout()
    shout()
    #Print echo_word
    print(echo_word)
#Call function echo_shout() with argument 'hello'    
echo_shout('hello')
```
