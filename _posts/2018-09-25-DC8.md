## NumPy and pandas working together
Pandas depends upon and interoperates with NumPy, the Python library for fast numeric array computations. For example, we can use the DataFrame attribute .values to represent a DataFrame df as a NumPy array. We can also pass pandas data structures to NumPy methods. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and loaded world population data every 10 years since 1960 into the DataFrame df. Our job is to extract the values and store them in an array using the attribute .values. We'll then use those values as input into the NumPy np.log10() method to compute the base 10 logarithm of the population values. Finally, we will pass the entire pandas DataFrame into the same NumPy np.log10() method and compare the results.

```python
# Import numpy
import numpy as np
# Create array of DataFrame values: np_vals
np_vals = df.values
# Create new array of base 10 logarithm values: np_vals_log10
np_vals_log10 = np.log10(np_vals)
# Create array of new DataFrame by passing df to np.log10(): df_log10
df_log10 = np.log10(df)
# Print original and new data containers
print(type(np_vals), type(np_vals_log10))
print(type(df), type(df_log10))
```

## Zip lists to build a DataFrame
We're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 'Total'. list_values contains the full names of each country and the number of gold medals awarded. The values have been taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table). Our job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, we'll make use of the list(), zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has already been imported as pd. Note: The [zip()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to use list().

```python
# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped
zipped = list(zip(list_keys,list_values))
# Inspect the list using print()
print(zipped)
# Build a dictionary with the zipped list: data
data = dict(zipped)
# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

## Labeling your data
We can use the DataFrame attribute df.columns to view and assign new string labels to columns in a pandas DataFrame. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and defined a DataFrame df containing top Billboard hits from the 1980s (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_number-one_singles_of_the_1980s#1980)). Each row has the year, artist, song name and the number of weeks at the top. However, this DataFrame has the column labels a, b, c, d. Our job is to use the df.columns attribute to re-assign descriptive column labels.

```python
# Build a list of labels: list_labels
list_labels = ['year','artist','song','chart weeks']
# Assign the list of labels to the columns attribute: df.columns
df.columns = list_labels
```

## Building DataFrames with broadcasting
We can implicitly use 'broadcasting', a feature of NumPy, when creating pandas DataFrames. We're going to create a DataFrame of cities in Pennsylvania that contains the city name in one column and the state name in the second. We have imported the names of 15 cities as the list cities. Our job is to construct a DataFrame from the list of cities and the string 'PA'.

```python
# Make a string with the value 'PA': state
state = 'PA'
# Construct a dictionary: data
data = {'state':state, 'city':cities}
# Construct a DataFrame from dictionary data: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```
## Reading a flat file
We have preloaded the data for you using the pandas function read_csv(). Now, it's our turn! Our job is to read the World Bank population data we saw earlier into a DataFrame using read_csv(). The file is available in the variable data_file. The next step is to reread the same file, but simultaneously rename the columns using the names keyword input parameter, set equal to a list of new column labels. We will also need to set header=0 to rename the column labels.

```python
# Read in the file: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv('world_population.csv')
# Create a list of the new column labels: new_labels
new_labels = ['year', 'population']
# Read in the file, specifying the header and names parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv('world_population.csv', header=0, names=new_labels)
# Print both the DataFrames
print(df1)
print(df2)
```

## Delimiters, headers, and extensions
Not all data files are clean and tidy. Pandas provides methods for reading those not-so-perfect data files that we encounter far too often. We have monthly stock data for four companies downloaded from [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/). The data is stored as one row for each company and each column is the end-of-month closing price. The file name is given to us in the variable file_messy. In addition, this file has three aspects that may cause trouble for lesser tools: multiple header lines, comment records (rows) interleaved throughout the data rows, and space delimiters instead of commas. Our job is to use pandas to read the data from this problematic file_messy using non-default input options with read_csv() so as to tidy up the mess at read time. Then, write the cleaned up data to a CSV file with the variable file_clean that has been prepared for us, as we might do in a real data workflow.

```python
# Read the raw file as-is: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv(file_messy)
# Print the output of df1.head()
print(df1.head())
# Read in the file with the correct parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv(file_messy, delimiter=' ', header=3, comment='#')
# Print the output of df2.head()
print(df2.head())
# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to a CSV file without the index
df2.to_csv(file_clean, index=False)
# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to an excel file without the index
df2.to_excel('file_clean.xlsx', index=False)
```

## Plotting series using pandas
Data visualization is often a very effective first step in gaining a rough understanding of a data set to be analyzed. Pandas provides data visualization by both depending upon and interoperating with the matplotlib library. We will now explore some of the basic plotting mechanics with pandas as well as related matplotlib options. We have pre-loaded a pandas DataFrame df which contains the data you need. Our job is to use the DataFrame method df.plot() to visualize the data, and then explore the optional matplotlib input parameters that this .plot() method accepts. The pandas .plot() method makes calls to matplotlib to construct the plots. This means that we can use the skills we've learned in previous visualization courses to customize the plot. In this exercise, we'll add a custom title and axis labels to the figure.

```python
# Create a plot with color='red'
df.plot(color='red')
# Add a title
plt.title('Temperature in Austin')
# Specify the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Hours since midnight August 1, 2010')
# Specify the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Temperature (degrees F)')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## Plotting DataFrames
Comparing data from several columns can be very illuminating. Pandas makes doing so easy with multi-column DataFrames. By default, calling df.plot() will cause pandas to over-plot all column data, with each column as a single line. In this exercise, we have pre-loaded three columns of data from a weather data set - temperature, dew point, and pressure - but the problem is that pressure has different units of measure. The pressure data, measured in Atmospheres, has a different vertical scaling than that of the other two data columns, which are both measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Our job is to plot all columns as a multi-line plot, to see the nature of vertical scaling problem. Then, use a list of column names passed into the DataFrame df[column_list] to limit plotting to just one column, and then just 2 columns of data. When we are finished, we will have created 4 plots. We can cycle through them by clicking on the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons.

```python
# Plot all columns (default)
df.plot()
plt.show()
# Plot all columns as subplots
df.plot(subplots=True)
plt.show()
# Plot just the Dew Point data
column_list1 = ['Dew Point (deg F)']
df[column_list1].plot()
plt.show()
# Plot the Dew Point and Temperature data, but not the Pressure data
column_list2 = ['Temperature (deg F)','Dew Point (deg F)']
df[column_list2].plot()
plt.show()
```

## pandas line plots
We saw that the .plot() method will place the Index values on the x-axis by default. We'll practice making line plots with specific columns on the x and y axes. We will work with a dataset consisting of monthly stock prices in 2015 for AAPL, GOOG, and IBM. The stock prices were obtained from [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/). Our job is to plot the 'Month' column on the x-axis and the AAPL and IBM prices on the y-axis using a list of column names. Explore it using methods such as .head(), .info(), and .describe() to see the column names.

```python
# Create a list of y-axis column names: y_columns
y_columns = ['AAPL','IBM']
# Generate a line plot
df.plot(x='Month', y=y_columns)
# Add the title
plt.title('Monthly stock prices')
# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price ($US)')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## pandas scatter plots
Pandas scatter plots are generated using the kind='scatter' keyword argument. Scatter plots require that the x and y columns be chosen by specifying the x and y parameters inside .plot(). Scatter plots also take an s keyword argument to provide the radius of each circle to plot in pixels. We're going to plot fuel efficiency (miles-per-gallon) versus horse-power for 392 automobiles manufactured from 1970 to 1982 from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG). The size of each circle is provided as a NumPy array called sizes. This array contains the normalized 'weight' of each automobile in the dataset.

```python
# Generate a scatter plot
df.plot(kind='scatter', x='hp', y='mpg', s=sizes)
# Add the title
plt.title('Fuel efficiency vs Horse-power')
# Add the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Horse-power')
# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Fuel efficiency (mpg)')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## pandas box plots
While pandas can plot multiple columns of data in a single figure, making plots that share the same x and y axes, there are cases where two columns cannot be plotted together because their units do not match. The .plot() method can generate subplots for each column being plotted. Here, each plot will be scaled independently. Our job is to generate box plots for fuel efficiency (mpg) and weight from the automobiles data set. To do this in a single figure, we'll specify subplots=True inside .plot() to generate two separate plots.

```python
# Make a list of the column names to be plotted: cols
cols = ['weight','mpg']
# Generate the box plots
df[cols].plot(kind='box', subplots=True)
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## pandas hist, pdf and cdf
Pandas relies on the .hist() method to not only generate histograms, but also plots of probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative density functions (CDFs). We will work with a dataset consisting of restaurant bills that includes the amount customers tipped. The original dataset is provided by the [Seaborn package](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/tips.csv). Our job is to plot a PDF and CDF for the fraction column of the tips dataset. This column contains information about what fraction of the total bill is comprised of the tip. Remember, when plotting the PDF, we need to specify normed=True in your call to .hist(), and when plotting the CDF, we need to specify cumulative=True in addition to normed=True.

```python
# This formats the plots such that they appear on separate rows
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1)
# Plot the PDF
df.fraction.plot(ax=axes[0], kind='hist', bins=30, normed=True, range=(0,.3))
plt.show()
# Plot the CDF
df.fraction.plot(ax=axes[1], kind='hist', bins=30, normed=True, cumulative=True, range=(0,.3))
plt.show()
```
