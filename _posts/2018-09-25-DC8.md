## NumPy and pandas working together
Pandas depends upon and interoperates with NumPy, the Python library for fast numeric array computations. For example, we can use the DataFrame attribute .values to represent a DataFrame df as a NumPy array. We can also pass pandas data structures to NumPy methods. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and loaded world population data every 10 years since 1960 into the DataFrame df. Our job is to extract the values and store them in an array using the attribute .values. We'll then use those values as input into the NumPy np.log10() method to compute the base 10 logarithm of the population values. Finally, we will pass the entire pandas DataFrame into the same NumPy np.log10() method and compare the results.

```python
# Import numpy
import numpy as np
# Create array of DataFrame values: np_vals
np_vals = df.values
# Create new array of base 10 logarithm values: np_vals_log10
np_vals_log10 = np.log10(np_vals)
# Create array of new DataFrame by passing df to np.log10(): df_log10
df_log10 = np.log10(df)
# Print original and new data containers
print(type(np_vals), type(np_vals_log10))
print(type(df), type(df_log10))
```

## Zip lists to build a DataFrame
We're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 'Total'. list_values contains the full names of each country and the number of gold medals awarded. The values have been taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table). Our job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, we'll make use of the list(), zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has already been imported as pd. Note: The [zip()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to use list().

```python
# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped
zipped = list(zip(list_keys,list_values))
# Inspect the list using print()
print(zipped)
# Build a dictionary with the zipped list: data
data = dict(zipped)
# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

## Labeling your data
We can use the DataFrame attribute df.columns to view and assign new string labels to columns in a pandas DataFrame. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and defined a DataFrame df containing top Billboard hits from the 1980s (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_number-one_singles_of_the_1980s#1980)). Each row has the year, artist, song name and the number of weeks at the top. However, this DataFrame has the column labels a, b, c, d. Our job is to use the df.columns attribute to re-assign descriptive column labels.

```python
# Build a list of labels: list_labels
list_labels = ['year','artist','song','chart weeks']
# Assign the list of labels to the columns attribute: df.columns
df.columns = list_labels
```

## Building DataFrames with broadcasting
We can implicitly use 'broadcasting', a feature of NumPy, when creating pandas DataFrames. We're going to create a DataFrame of cities in Pennsylvania that contains the city name in one column and the state name in the second. We have imported the names of 15 cities as the list cities. Our job is to construct a DataFrame from the list of cities and the string 'PA'.

```python
# Make a string with the value 'PA': state
state = 'PA'
# Construct a dictionary: data
data = {'state':state, 'city':cities}
# Construct a DataFrame from dictionary data: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```
## Reading a flat file
We have preloaded the data for you using the pandas function read_csv(). Now, it's our turn! Our job is to read the World Bank population data we saw earlier into a DataFrame using read_csv(). The file is available in the variable data_file. The next step is to reread the same file, but simultaneously rename the columns using the names keyword input parameter, set equal to a list of new column labels. We will also need to set header=0 to rename the column labels.

```python
# Read in the file: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv('world_population.csv')
# Create a list of the new column labels: new_labels
new_labels = ['year', 'population']
# Read in the file, specifying the header and names parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv('world_population.csv', header=0, names=new_labels)
# Print both the DataFrames
print(df1)
print(df2)
```

## Delimiters, headers, and extensions
Not all data files are clean and tidy. Pandas provides methods for reading those not-so-perfect data files that we encounter far too often. We have monthly stock data for four companies downloaded from [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/). The data is stored as one row for each company and each column is the end-of-month closing price. The file name is given to us in the variable file_messy. In addition, this file has three aspects that may cause trouble for lesser tools: multiple header lines, comment records (rows) interleaved throughout the data rows, and space delimiters instead of commas. Our job is to use pandas to read the data from this problematic file_messy using non-default input options with read_csv() so as to tidy up the mess at read time. Then, write the cleaned up data to a CSV file with the variable file_clean that has been prepared for us, as we might do in a real data workflow.

```python
# Read the raw file as-is: df1
df1 = pd.read_csv(file_messy)
# Print the output of df1.head()
print(df1.head())
# Read in the file with the correct parameters: df2
df2 = pd.read_csv(file_messy, delimiter=' ', header=3, comment='#')
# Print the output of df2.head()
print(df2.head())
# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to a CSV file without the index
df2.to_csv(file_clean, index=False)
# Save the cleaned up DataFrame to an excel file without the index
df2.to_excel('file_clean.xlsx', index=False)
```

## Plotting series using pandas
Data visualization is often a very effective first step in gaining a rough understanding of a data set to be analyzed. Pandas provides data visualization by both depending upon and interoperating with the matplotlib library. We will now explore some of the basic plotting mechanics with pandas as well as related matplotlib options. We have pre-loaded a pandas DataFrame df which contains the data you need. Our job is to use the DataFrame method df.plot() to visualize the data, and then explore the optional matplotlib input parameters that this .plot() method accepts. The pandas .plot() method makes calls to matplotlib to construct the plots. This means that we can use the skills we've learned in previous visualization courses to customize the plot. In this exercise, we'll add a custom title and axis labels to the figure.

```python
# Create a plot with color='red'
df.plot(color='red')
# Add a title
plt.title('Temperature in Austin')
# Specify the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Hours since midnight August 1, 2010')
# Specify the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Temperature (degrees F)')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## Plotting DataFrames
Comparing data from several columns can be very illuminating. Pandas makes doing so easy with multi-column DataFrames. By default, calling df.plot() will cause pandas to over-plot all column data, with each column as a single line. In this exercise, we have pre-loaded three columns of data from a weather data set - temperature, dew point, and pressure - but the problem is that pressure has different units of measure. The pressure data, measured in Atmospheres, has a different vertical scaling than that of the other two data columns, which are both measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Our job is to plot all columns as a multi-line plot, to see the nature of vertical scaling problem. Then, use a list of column names passed into the DataFrame df[column_list] to limit plotting to just one column, and then just 2 columns of data. When we are finished, we will have created 4 plots. We can cycle through them by clicking on the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons.

```python
# Plot all columns (default)
df.plot()
plt.show()
# Plot all columns as subplots
df.plot(subplots=True)
plt.show()
# Plot just the Dew Point data
column_list1 = ['Dew Point (deg F)']
df[column_list1].plot()
plt.show()
# Plot the Dew Point and Temperature data, but not the Pressure data
column_list2 = ['Temperature (deg F)','Dew Point (deg F)']
df[column_list2].plot()
plt.show()
```

## pandas line plots
We saw that the .plot() method will place the Index values on the x-axis by default. We'll practice making line plots with specific columns on the x and y axes. We will work with a dataset consisting of monthly stock prices in 2015 for AAPL, GOOG, and IBM. The stock prices were obtained from [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/). Our job is to plot the 'Month' column on the x-axis and the AAPL and IBM prices on the y-axis using a list of column names. Explore it using methods such as .head(), .info(), and .describe() to see the column names.

```python
# Create a list of y-axis column names: y_columns
y_columns = ['AAPL','IBM']
# Generate a line plot
df.plot(x='Month', y=y_columns)
# Add the title
plt.title('Monthly stock prices')
# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price ($US)')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## pandas scatter plots
Pandas scatter plots are generated using the kind='scatter' keyword argument. Scatter plots require that the x and y columns be chosen by specifying the x and y parameters inside .plot(). Scatter plots also take an s keyword argument to provide the radius of each circle to plot in pixels. We're going to plot fuel efficiency (miles-per-gallon) versus horse-power for 392 automobiles manufactured from 1970 to 1982 from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG). The size of each circle is provided as a NumPy array called sizes. This array contains the normalized 'weight' of each automobile in the dataset.

```python
# Generate a scatter plot
df.plot(kind='scatter', x='hp', y='mpg', s=sizes)
# Add the title
plt.title('Fuel efficiency vs Horse-power')
# Add the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Horse-power')
# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Fuel efficiency (mpg)')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## pandas box plots
While pandas can plot multiple columns of data in a single figure, making plots that share the same x and y axes, there are cases where two columns cannot be plotted together because their units do not match. The .plot() method can generate subplots for each column being plotted. Here, each plot will be scaled independently. Our job is to generate box plots for fuel efficiency (mpg) and weight from the automobiles data set. To do this in a single figure, we'll specify subplots=True inside .plot() to generate two separate plots.

```python
# Make a list of the column names to be plotted: cols
cols = ['weight','mpg']
# Generate the box plots
df[cols].plot(kind='box', subplots=True)
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## pandas hist, pdf and cdf
Pandas relies on the .hist() method to not only generate histograms, but also plots of probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative density functions (CDFs). We will work with a dataset consisting of restaurant bills that includes the amount customers tipped. The original dataset is provided by the [Seaborn package](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/tips.csv). Our job is to plot a PDF and CDF for the fraction column of the tips dataset. This column contains information about what fraction of the total bill is comprised of the tip. Remember, when plotting the PDF, we need to specify normed=True in your call to .hist(), and when plotting the CDF, we need to specify cumulative=True in addition to normed=True.

```python
# This formats the plots such that they appear on separate rows
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1)
# Plot the PDF
df.fraction.plot(ax=axes[0], kind='hist', bins=30, normed=True, range=(0,.3))
plt.show()
# Plot the CDF
df.fraction.plot(ax=axes[1], kind='hist', bins=30, normed=True, cumulative=True, range=(0,.3))
plt.show()
```

## Bachelor's degrees awarded to women
We will investigate statistics of the percentage of Bachelor's degrees awarded to women from 1970 to 2011. Data is recorded every year for 17 different fields. This data set was obtained from the [Digest of Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp). Our job is to compute the minimum and maximum values of the 'Engineering' column and generate a line plot of the mean value of all 17 academic fields per year. To perform this step, we'll use the .mean() method with the keyword argument axis='columns'. This computes the mean across all columns per row.

```python
# Print the minimum value of the Engineering column
print(df['Engineering'].min())
# Print the maximum value of the Engineering column
print(df['Engineering'].max())
# Construct the mean percentage per year: mean
mean = df.mean(axis='columns')
# Plot the average percentage per year
mean.plot(x='Year')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## Median vs mean
In many data sets, there can be large differences in the mean and median value due to the presence of outliers. We'll investigate the mean, median, and max fare prices paid by passengers on the Titanic and generate a box plot of the fare prices. This data set was obtained from [Vanderbilt University](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic.html).

```python
# Print summary statistics of the fare column with .describe()
print(df['fare'].describe())
# Generate a box plot of the fare column
df['fare'].plot(kind='box')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Quantiles
We'll investigate the probabilities of life expectancy in countries around the world. This dataset contains life expectancy for persons born each year from 1800 to 2015. Since country names change or results are not reported, not every country has values. This dataset was obtained from [Gapminder](https://docs.google.com/a/continuum.io/spreadsheets/d/1dgOdlUEq6_V55OHZCxz5BG_0uoghJTeA6f83br5peNs/pub?range=A1:D70&gid=1&output=html#). First, we will determine the number of countries reported in 2015. There are a total of 260 unique countries in the entire dataset. Then, we will compute the 5th and 95th percentiles of life expectancy over the entire dataset. Finally, we will make a box plot of life expectancy every 50 years from 1800 to 2000. Notice the large change in the distributions over this period.

```python
# Print the number of countries reported in 2015
print(df['2015'].count())
# Print the 5th and 95th percentiles
print(df.quantile([0.05,0.95]))
# Generate a box plot
years = ['1800','1850','1900','1950','2000']
df[years].plot(kind='box')
plt.show()
```

## Standard deviation of temperature
Let's use the mean and standard deviation to explore differences in temperature distributions in Pittsburgh in 2013. The data has been obtained from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/). We're going to compare the distribution of daily temperatures in January and March. We'll compute the mean and standard deviation for these two months. We will notice that while the mean values are similar, the standard deviations are quite different, meaning that one month had a larger fluctuation in temperature than the other.

```python
# Print the mean of the January and March data
print(january.mean(),march.mean())
# Print the standard deviation of the January and March data
print(january.std(),march.std())
```

## Separate and summarize
Let's use population filtering to determine how the automobiles in the US differ from the global average and standard deviation. How does the distribution of fuel efficiency (MPG) for the US differ from the global average and standard deviation? We'll compute the means and standard deviations of all columns in the full automobile dataset. Next, we'll compute the same quantities for just the US population and subtract the global values from the US values.

```python
# Compute the global mean and global standard deviation: global_mean, global_std
global_mean = df.mean()
global_std = df.std()
# Filter the US population from the origin column: us
us = df[df['origin']=='US']
# Compute the US mean and US standard deviation: us_mean, us_std
us_mean = us.mean()
us_std = us.std()
# Print the differences
print(us_mean - global_mean)
print(us_std - global_std)
```

## Separate and plot
Population filtering can be used alongside plotting to quickly determine differences in distributions between the sub-populations. We'll work with the Titanic dataset. There were three passenger classes on the Titanic, and passengers in each class paid a different fare price. We'll investigate the differences in these fare prices. Our job is to use Boolean filtering and generate box plots of the fare prices for each of the three passenger classes. The fare prices are contained in the 'fare' column and passenger class information is contained in the 'pclass' column. When you're done, notice the portions of the box plots that differ and those that are similar.

```python
# Display the box plots on 3 separate rows and 1 column
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=3, ncols=1)
# Generate a box plot of the fare prices for the First passenger class
titanic.loc[titanic['pclass'] == 1].plot(ax=axes[0],y='fare', kind='box')
# Generate a box plot of the fare prices for the Second passenger class
titanic.loc[titanic['pclass'] == 2].plot(ax=axes[1],y='fare', kind='box')
# Generate a box plot of the fare prices for the Third passenger class
titanic.loc[titanic['pclass'] == 3].plot(ax=axes[2],y='fare', kind='box')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## Creating and using a DatetimeIndex
The pandas Index is a powerful way to handle time series data, so it is valuable to know how to build one yourself. Pandas provides the pd.to_datetime() function for just this task. For example, if passed the list of strings ['2015-01-01 091234','2015-01-01 091234'] and a format specification variable, such as format='%Y-%m-%d %H%M%S, pandas will parse the string into the proper datetime elements and build the datetime objects. Here a list of temperature data and a list of date strings has been pre-loaded for you as temperature_list and date_list respectively. Our job is to use the .to_datetime() method to build a DatetimeIndex out of the list of date strings, and to then use it along with the list of temperature data to build a pandas Series.

```python
# Prepare a format string: time_format
time_format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'
# Convert date_list into a datetime object: my_datetimes
my_datetimes = pd.to_datetime(date_list,format=time_format)  
# Construct a pandas Series using temperature_list and my_datetimes: time_series
time_series = pd.Series(temperature_list, index=my_datetimes)
```

## Partial string indexing and slicing
Pandas time series support "partial string" indexing. What this means is that even when passed only a portion of the datetime, such as the date but not the time, pandas is remarkably good at doing what one would expect. Pandas datetime indexing also supports a wide variety of commonly used datetime string formats, even when mixed. In this exercise, a time series that contains hourly weather data has been pre-loaded for us. This data was read using the parse_dates=True option in read_csv() with index_col="Dates" so that the Index is indeed a DatetimeIndex. All data from the 'Temperature' column has been extracted into the variable ts0. Our job is to use a variety of natural date strings to extract one or more values from ts0. After we are done, we will have three new variables - ts1, ts2, and ts3. We can slice these further to extract only the first and last entries of each.

```python
# Extract the hour from 9pm to 10pm on '2010-10-11': ts1
ts1 = ts0.loc['2010-10-11 21:00:00':'2010-10-11 22:00:00']
# Extract '2010-07-04' from ts0: ts2
ts2 = ts0.loc['2010-07-04']
# Extract data from '2010-12-15' to '2010-12-31': ts3
ts3 = ts0.loc['2010-12-15':'2010-12-31']
```

## Reindexing the Index
Reindexing is useful in preparation for adding or otherwise combining two time series data sets. To reindex the data, we provide a new index and ask pandas to try and match the old data to the new index. If data is unavailable for one of the new index dates or times, we must tell pandas how to fill it in. Otherwise, pandas will fill with NaN by default. Two time series data sets containing daily data have been pre-loaded for us, each indexed by dates. The first, ts1, includes weekends, but the second, ts2, does not. The goal is to combine the two data sets in a sensible way. Our job is to reindex the second data set so that it has weekends as well, and then add it to the first. When we are done, it would be informative to inspect your results.

```python
# Reindex without fill method: ts3
ts3 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index)
# Reindex with fill method, using forward fill: ts4
ts4 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index, method='ffill')
# Combine ts1 + ts2: sum12
sum12 = ts1+ts2
# Combine ts1 + ts3: sum13
sum13 = ts1 + ts3
# Combine ts1 + ts4: sum14
sum14 = ts1 + ts4
```

## Resampling and frequency
Pandas provides methods for resampling time series data. When downsampling or upsampling, the syntax is similar, but the methods called are different. Both use the concept of 'method chaining' - df.method1().method2().method3() - to direct the output from one method call to the input of the next, and so on, as a sequence of operations, one feeding into the next. For example, if you have hourly data, and just need daily data, pandas will not guess how to throw out the 23 of 24 points. You must specify this in the method. One approach, for instance, could be to take the mean, as in df.resample('D').mean(). Our job is to resample the data using a variety of aggregation methods to answer a few questions.

```python
# Downsample to 6 hour data and aggregate by mean: df1
df1 = df['Temperature'].resample('6H').mean()
# Downsample to daily data and count the number of data points: df2
df2 = df['Temperature'].resample('D').count()
```

## Separating and resampling
With pandas, we can resample in different ways on different subsets of your data. For example, resampling different months of data with different aggregations. In this exercise, the data set containing hourly temperature data from the last exercise has been pre-loaded. Our job is to resample the data using a variety of aggregation methods. The DataFrame is available in the workspace as df.

```python
# Extract temperature data for August: august
august = df.loc['August,2010','Temperature']
# Downsample to obtain only the daily highest temperatures in August: august_highs
august_highs = august.resample('D').max()
# Extract temperature data for February: february
february = df.loc['February,2010','Temperature']
# Downsample to obtain the daily lowest temperatures in February: february_lows
february_lows = february.resample('D').min()
```
