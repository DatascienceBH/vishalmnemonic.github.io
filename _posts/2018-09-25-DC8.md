## NumPy and pandas working together
Pandas depends upon and interoperates with NumPy, the Python library for fast numeric array computations. For example, we can use the DataFrame attribute .values to represent a DataFrame df as a NumPy array. We can also pass pandas data structures to NumPy methods. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and loaded world population data every 10 years since 1960 into the DataFrame df. Our job is to extract the values and store them in an array using the attribute .values. We'll then use those values as input into the NumPy np.log10() method to compute the base 10 logarithm of the population values. Finally, we will pass the entire pandas DataFrame into the same NumPy np.log10() method and compare the results.

```python
# Import numpy
import numpy as np
# Create array of DataFrame values: np_vals
np_vals = df.values
# Create new array of base 10 logarithm values: np_vals_log10
np_vals_log10 = np.log10(np_vals)
# Create array of new DataFrame by passing df to np.log10(): df_log10
df_log10 = np.log10(df)
# Print original and new data containers
print(type(np_vals), type(np_vals_log10))
print(type(df), type(df_log10))
```

## Zip lists to build a DataFrame
We're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 'Total'. list_values contains the full names of each country and the number of gold medals awarded. The values have been taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table). Our job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, we'll make use of the list(), zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has already been imported as pd. Note: The [zip()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to use list().

```python
# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped
zipped = list(zip(list_keys,list_values))
# Inspect the list using print()
print(zipped)
# Build a dictionary with the zipped list: data
data = dict(zipped)
# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

## Labeling your data
We can use the DataFrame attribute df.columns to view and assign new string labels to columns in a pandas DataFrame. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and defined a DataFrame df containing top Billboard hits from the 1980s (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_number-one_singles_of_the_1980s#1980)). Each row has the year, artist, song name and the number of weeks at the top. However, this DataFrame has the column labels a, b, c, d. Our job is to use the df.columns attribute to re-assign descriptive column labels.

```python
# Build a list of labels: list_labels
list_labels = ['year','artist','song','chart weeks']
# Assign the list of labels to the columns attribute: df.columns
df.columns = list_labels
```

## Building DataFrames with broadcasting
We can implicitly use 'broadcasting', a feature of NumPy, when creating pandas DataFrames. We're going to create a DataFrame of cities in Pennsylvania that contains the city name in one column and the state name in the second. We have imported the names of 15 cities as the list cities. Our job is to construct a DataFrame from the list of cities and the string 'PA'.

```python
# Make a string with the value 'PA': state
state = 'PA'
# Construct a dictionary: data
data = {'state':state, 'city':cities}
# Construct a DataFrame from dictionary data: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```
