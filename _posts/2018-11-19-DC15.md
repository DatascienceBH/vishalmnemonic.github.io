## How often do we get no-hitters?
The number of games played between each no-hitter in the modern era (1901-2015) of Major League Baseball is stored in the array nohitter_times. If we assume that no-hitters are described as a Poisson process, then the time between no-hitters is Exponentially distributed. As we have seen, the Exponential distribution has a single parameter, which we will call τ, the typical interval time. The value of the parameter τ that makes the exponential distribution best match the data is the mean interval time (where time is in units of number of games) between no-hitters.

Compute the value of this parameter from the data. Then, use np.random.exponential() to "repeat" the history of Major League Baseball by drawing inter-no-hitter times from an exponential distribution with the τ you found and plot the histogram as an approximation to the PDF. NumPy, pandas, matlotlib.pyplot, and seaborn have been imported for you as np, pd, plt, and sns, respectively.

```python
# Seed random number generator
np.random.seed(42)
# Compute mean no-hitter time: tau
tau = np.mean(nohitter_times)
# Draw out of an exponential distribution with parameter tau: inter_nohitter_time
inter_nohitter_time = np.random.exponential(tau, 100000)
# Plot the PDF and label axes
_ = plt.hist(inter_nohitter_time,
             bins=50, normed=True, histtype='step')
_ = plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Do the data follow our story?
We have modeled no-hitters using an Exponential distribution. Create an ECDF of the real data. Overlay the theoretical CDF with the ECDF from the data. This helps us to verify that the Exponential distribution describes the observed data. It may be helpful to remind ourself of the function we created in the previous course to compute the ECDF, as well as the code you wrote to plot it.

```python
# Create an ECDF from real data: x, y
x, y = ecdf(nohitter_times)
# Create a CDF from theoretical samples: x_theor, y_theor
x_theor, y_theor = ecdf(inter_nohitter_time)
# Overlay the plots
plt.plot(x_theor, y_theor, marker='.', linestyle='none')
plt.plot(x, y,marker='.', linestyle='none')
# Margins and axis labels
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## How is this parameter optimal?
Now sample out of an exponential distribution with τ being twice as large as the optimal τ. Do it again for τ half as large. Make CDFs of these samples and overlay them with your data. We can see that they do not reproduce the data as well. Thus, the τ we computed from the mean inter-no-hitter times is optimal in that it best reproduces the data.

```python
# Plot the theoretical CDFs
plt.plot(x_theor, y_theor)
plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none')
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.xlabel('Games between no-hitters')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
# Take samples with half tau: samples_half
samples_half = np.random.exponential(tau/2,size=10000)
# Take samples with double tau: samples_double
samples_double = np.random.exponential(2*tau,size=10000)
# Generate CDFs from these samples
x_half, y_half = ecdf(samples_half)
x_double, y_double = ecdf(samples_double)
# Plot these CDFs as lines
_ = plt.plot(x_half, y_half)
_ = plt.plot(x_double, y_double)
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## EDA of literacy/fertility data
In the next few exercises, we will look at the correlation between female literacy and fertility (defined as the average number of children born per woman) throughout the world. For ease of analysis and interpretation, we will work with the illiteracy rate. It is always a good idea to do some EDA ahead of our analysis. To this end, plot the fertility versus illiteracy and compute the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Numpy array illiteracy has the illiteracy rate among females for most of the world's nations. The array fertility has the corresponding fertility data. Here, it may be useful to refer back to the function we wrote in the previous course to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient.

```python
# Plot the illiteracy rate versus fertility
_ = plt.plot(x=illiteracy, y=fertility, marker='.', linestyle='none')
# Set the margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('percent illiterate')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
# Show the Pearson correlation coefficient
print(pearson_r(illiteracy, fertility))
```

## Linear regression
We will assume that fertility is a linear function of the female illiteracy rate. That is, f=ai+b, where a is the slope and b is the intercept. We can think of the intercept as the minimal fertility rate, probably somewhere between one and two. The slope tells us how the fertility rate varies with illiteracy. We can find the best fit line using np.polyfit(). Plot the data and the best fit line. Print out the slope and intercept. (Think: what are their units?)

```python
# Plot the illiteracy rate versus fertility
_ = plt.plot(illiteracy, fertility, marker='.', linestyle='none')
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('percent illiterate')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')
# Perform a linear regression using np.polyfit(): a, b
a, b = np.polyfit(illiteracy,fertility,1)
# Print the results to the screen
print('slope =', a, 'children per woman / percent illiterate')
print('intercept =', b, 'children per woman')
# Make theoretical line to plot
x = np.array([0,100])
y = a * x + b
# Add regression line to your plot
_ = plt.plot(x,y )
# Draw the plot
plt.show()
```

## How is it optimal?
The function np.polyfit() that we used to get our regression parameters finds the optimal slope and intercept. It is optimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, also known as RSS (for residual sum of squares). In this exercise, we will plot the function that is being optimized, the RSS, versus the slope parameter a. To do this, fix the intercept to be what we found in the optimization. Then, plot the RSS vs. the slope. Where is it minimal?

```python
# Specify slopes to consider: a_vals
a_vals = np.linspace(0,0.1,200)
# Initialize sum of square of residuals: rss
rss = np.empty_like(a_vals)
# Compute sum of square of residuals for each value of a_vals
for i, a in enumerate(a_vals):
    rss[i] = np.sum((fertility - a * illiteracy - b)**2)
# Plot the RSS
plt.plot(a_vals,rss, '-')
plt.xlabel('slope (children per woman / percent illiterate)')
plt.ylabel('sum of square of residuals')
plt.show()
```

## Linear regression on appropriate Anscombe data
For practice, perform a linear regression on the data set from Anscombe's quartet that is most reasonably interpreted with linear regression.

```python
# Perform linear regression: a, b
a, b = np.polyfit(x,y,1)
# Print the slope and intercept
print(a, b)
# Generate theoretical x and y data: x_theor, y_theor
x_theor = np.array([3, 15])
y_theor = a * x_theor + b
# Plot the Anscombe data and theoretical line
_ = plt.plot(x,y,marker='.',linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_theor,y_theor,marker='.',linestyle='none')
# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Linear regression on all Anscombe data
Now, to verify that all four of the Anscombe data sets have the same slope and intercept from a linear regression, we will compute the slope and intercept for each set. The data are stored in lists; anscombe_x = [x1, x2, x3, x4] and anscombe_y = [y1, y2, y3, y4], where, for example, x2 and y2 are the x and y values for the second Anscombe data set.

```python
# Iterate through x,y pairs
for x, y in zip(anscombe_x, anscombe_y):
    # Compute the slope and intercept: a, b
    a, b = np.polyfit(x,y,1)
    # Print the result
    print('slope:', a, 'intercept:', b)
```

Getting tripped up over terminology is a common cause of frustration in students. Unfortunately, you often will read and hear other data scientists using different terminology for bootstrap samples and replicates. This is even more reason why we need everything to be clear and consistent for this course. So, before going forward discussing bootstrapping, let's get our terminology down. If we have a data set with n repeated measurements, a bootstrap sample is an array of length n that was drawn from the original data with replacement, bootstrap replicate is a single value of a statistic computed from a bootstrap sample.

## Visualizing bootstrap samples
We will generate bootstrap samples from the set of annual rainfall data measured at the Sheffield Weather Station in the UK from 1883 to 2015. The data are stored in the NumPy array rainfall in units of millimeters (mm). By graphically displaying the bootstrap samples with an ECDF, we can get a feel for how bootstrap sampling allows probabilistic descriptions of data.

```python
for i in range(50):
    # Generate bootstrap sample: bs_sample
    bs_sample = np.random.choice(rainfall, size=len(rainfall))
    # Compute and plot ECDF from bootstrap sample
    x, y = ecdf(bs_sample)
    _ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='gray', alpha=0.1)
# Compute and plot ECDF from original data
x, y = ecdf(rainfall)
_ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.')
# Make margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('yearly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Generating many bootstrap replicates
Now we'll write a function, draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1), which generates many bootstrap replicates from the data set. This function will come in handy for us again and again as we compute confidence intervals and later when we do hypothesis tests. For your reference, the bootstrap_replicate_1d() function is provided below:
```
def bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func):
    return func(np.random.choice(data, size=len(data)))
```

```python
def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
    """Draw bootstrap replicates."""
    # Initialize array of replicates: bs_replicates
    bs_replicates = np.empty(size)
    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_replicates[i] = bootstrap_replicate_1d(data,func)
    return bs_replicates
```

## Bootstrap replicates of the mean and the SEM
We will compute a bootstrap estimate of the probability density function of the mean annual rainfall at the Sheffield Weather Station. Remember, we are estimating the mean annual rainfall we would get if the Sheffield Weather Station could repeat all of the measurements from 1883 to 2015 over and over again. This is a probabilistic estimate of the mean. You will plot the PDF as a histogram, and you will see that it is Normal.

In fact, it can be shown theoretically that under not-too-restrictive conditions, the value of the mean will always be Normally distributed. (This does not hold in general, just for the mean and a few other statistics.) The standard deviation of this distribution, called the standard error of the mean, or SEM, is given by the standard deviation of the data divided by the square root of the number of data points. I.e., for a data set, sem = np.std(data) / np.sqrt(len(data)). Using hacker statistics, we get this same result without the need to derive it, but we will verify this result from your bootstrap replicates.

```python
# Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall,np.mean,size=10000)
# Compute and print SEM
sem = np.std(rainfall) / np.sqrt(len(rainfall))
print(sem)
# Compute and print standard deviation of bootstrap replicates
bs_std = np.std(bs_replicates)
print(bs_std)
# Make a histogram of the results
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('mean annual rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Bootstrap replicates of other statistics
We saw in a previous exercise that the mean is Normally distributed. This does not necessarily hold for other statistics, but no worry: as hackers, we can always take bootstrap replicates! In this exercise, we'll generate bootstrap replicates for the variance of the annual rainfall at the Sheffield Weather Station and plot the histogram of the replicates. Here, we will make use of the draw_bs_reps() function you defined a few exercises ago. It is provided below for your reference:
```
def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
  return np.array([bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func) for _ in range(size)])
```

```python
# Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the variance: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall,np.var,size=10000)
# Put the variance in units of square centimeters
bs_replicates=bs_replicates/100
# Make a histogram of the results
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50,normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('variance of annual rainfall (sq. cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Confidence interval on the rate of no-hitters
Consider again the inter-no-hitter intervals for the modern era of baseball. Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the optimal parameter τ. Plot a histogram of your replicates and report a 95% confidence interval.

```python
# Draw bootstrap replicates of the mean no-hitter time (equal to tau): bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(nohitter_times,np.mean,size=10000)
# Compute the 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_replicates,[2.5,97.5])
# Print the confidence interval
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'games')
# Plot the histogram of the replicates
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel(r'$\tau$ (games)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## A function to do pairs bootstrap
Pairs bootstrap involves resampling pairs of data. Each collection of pairs fit with a line, in this case using np.polyfit(). We do this again and again, getting bootstrap replicates of the parameter values. To have a useful tool for doing pairs bootstrap, we will write a function to perform pairs bootstrap on a set of x,y data.

```python
def draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1):
    """Perform pairs bootstrap for linear regression."""
    # Set up array of indices to sample from: inds
    inds = np.arange(len(x))
    # Initialize replicates: bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps
    bs_slope_reps = np.empty(size)
    bs_intercept_reps = np.empty(size)
    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_inds = np.random.choice(inds, size=len(inds))
        bs_x, bs_y = x[bs_inds], y[bs_inds]
        bs_slope_reps[i], bs_intercept_reps[i] = np.polyfit(bs_x,bs_y,1)
    return bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps
```

## Pairs bootstrap of literacy/fertility data
Using the function we just wrote, perform pairs bootstrap to plot a histogram describing the estimate of the slope from the illiteracy/fertility data. Also report the 95% confidence interval of the slope. The data is available to us in the NumPy arrays illiteracy and fertility. As a reminder, draw_bs_pairs_linreg() has a function signature of draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1), and it returns two values: bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps.

```python
# Generate replicates of slope and intercept using pairs bootstrap
bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps = draw_bs_pairs_linreg(illiteracy,fertility,size=1000)
# Compute and print 95% CI for slope
print(np.percentile(bs_slope_reps, [2.5,97.5]))
# Plot the histogram
_ = plt.hist(bs_slope_reps, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('slope')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.show()
```

## Plotting bootstrap regressions
A nice way to visualize the variability we might expect in a linear regression is to plot the line we would get from each bootstrap replicate of the slope and intercept. Do this for the first 100 of your bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept (stored as bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps).

```python
# Generate array of x-values for bootstrap lines: x
x = np.array([0,100])
# Plot the bootstrap lines
for i in range(100):
    _ = plt.plot(x, bs_slope_reps[i]*x +bs_intercept_reps[i],
                 linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.2, color='red')
# Plot the data
_ = plt.plot(illiteracy,fertility,marker='.',linestyle='none')
# Label axes, set the margins, and show the plot
_ = plt.xlabel('illiteracy')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.show()
```
