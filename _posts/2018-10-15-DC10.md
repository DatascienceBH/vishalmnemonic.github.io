## Reading DataFrames from multiple files
When data is spread among several files, we usually invoke pandas' read_csv() (or a similar data import function) multiple times to load the data into several DataFrames. The data files for this example have been derived from a [list of Olympic medals awarded between 1896 & 2008](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/jun/25/olympic-medal-winner-list-data) compiled by the Guardian. The column labels of each DataFrame are NOC, Country, & Total where NOC is a three-letter code for the name of the country and Total is the number of medals of that type won (bronze, silver, or gold).

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Read 'Bronze.csv' into a DataFrame: bronze
bronze = pd.read_csv('Bronze.csv')
# Read 'Silver.csv' into a DataFrame: silver
silver =  pd.read_csv('Silver.csv')
# Read 'Gold.csv' into a DataFrame: gold
gold =  pd.read_csv('Gold.csv')
# Print the first five rows of gold
print(gold.head())
```

## Reading DataFrames from multiple files in a loop
Loading data from multiple files into DataFrames is more efficient in a loop or a list comprehension. Notice that this approach is not restricted to working with CSV files. That is, even if our data comes in other formats, as long as pandas has a suitable data import function, we can apply a loop or comprehension to generate a list of DataFrames imported from the source files. Here, we'll continue working with [The Guardian's Olympic medal dataset](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/jun/25/olympic-medal-winner-list-data).

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Create the list of file names: filenames
filenames = ['Gold.csv', 'Silver.csv', 'Bronze.csv']
# Create the list of three DataFrames: dataframes
dataframes = []
for filename in filenames:
    dataframes.append(pd.read_csv(filename))
# Print top 5 rows of 1st DataFrame in dataframes
print(dataframes[0].head())
```

## Combining DataFrames from multiple data files
In this exercise, we'll combine the three DataFrames from earlier exercises - gold, silver, & bronze - into a single DataFrame called medals. The approach we'll use here is clumsy. Later on in the course, we'll see various powerful methods that are frequently used in practice for concatenating or merging DataFrames. Remember, the column labels of each DataFrame are NOC, Country, and Total, where NOC is a three-letter code for the name of the country and Total is the number of medals of that type won.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Make a copy of gold: medals
medals = gold.copy()
# Create list of new column labels: new_labels
new_labels = ['NOC', 'Country', 'Gold']
# Rename the columns of medals using new_labels
medals.columns = new_labels
# Add columns 'Silver' & 'Bronze' to medals
medals['Silver'] = silver['Total']
medals['Bronze'] = bronze['Total']
# Print the head of medals
print(medals.head())
```

## Sorting DataFrame with the Index & columns
It is often useful to rearrange the sequence of the rows of a DataFrame by sorting. We don't have to implement these yourself; the principal methods for doing this are .sort_index() and .sort_values(). In this exercise, we'll use these methods with a DataFrame of temperature values indexed by month names. We'll sort the rows alphabetically using the Index and numerically using a column. Notice, for this data, the original ordering is probably most useful and intuitive: the purpose here is for you to understand what the sorting methods do.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Read 'monthly_max_temp.csv' into a DataFrame: weather1
weather1 = pd.read_csv('monthly_max_temp.csv', index_col='Month')
# Print the head of weather1
print(weather1.head())
# Sort the index of weather1 in alphabetical order: weather2
weather2 = weather1.sort_index()
# Print the head of weather2
print(weather2.head())
# Sort the index of weather1 in reverse alphabetical order: weather3
weather3 = weather1.sort_index(ascending=False)
# Print the head of weather3
print(weather3.head())
# Sort weather1 numerically using the values of 'Max TemperatureF': weather4
weather4 = weather1.sort_index(by='Max TemperatureF')
# Print the head of weather4
print(weather4.head())
```

## Reindexing DataFrame from a list
Sorting methods are not the only way to change DataFrame Indexes. There is also the .reindex() method. In this exercise, we'll reindex a DataFrame of quarterly-sampled mean temperature values to contain monthly samples (this is an example of upsampling or increasing the rate of samples, which we may recall from the [pandas Foundations](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations) course). The original data has the first month's abbreviation of the quarter (three-month interval) on the Index, namely Apr, Jan, Jul, and Oct. This data has been loaded into a DataFrame called weather1 and has been printed in its entirety in the IPython Shell. Notice it has only four rows (corresponding to the first month of each quarter) and that the rows are not sorted chronologically. We'll initially use a list of all twelve month abbreviations and subsequently apply the .ffill() method to forward-fill the null entries when upsampling. This list of month abbreviations has been pre-loaded as year.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Reindex weather1 using the list year: weather2
weather2 = weather1.reindex(year)
# Print weather2
print(weather2)
# Reindex weather1 using the list year with forward-fill: weather3
weather3 = weather1.reindex(year).ffill()
# Print weather3
print(weather3)
```

## Reindexing using another DataFrame Index
Another common technique is to reindex a DataFrame using the Index of another DataFrame. The DataFrame .reindex() method can accept the Index of a DataFrame or Series as input. We can access the Index of a DataFrame with its .index attribute. The [Baby Names Dataset](https://www.data.gov/developers/baby-names-dataset/) from [data.gov](http://data.gov/) summarizes counts of names (with genders) from births registered in the US since 1881. In this exercise, we will start with two baby-names DataFrames names_1981 and names_1881 loaded for us. The DataFrames names_1981 and names_1881 both have a MultiIndex with levels name and gender giving unique labels to counts in each row. If you're interested in seeing how the MultiIndexes were set up, names_1981 and names_1881 were read in using the following commands:
```
names_1981 = pd.read_csv('names1981.csv', header=None, names=['name','gender','count'], index_col=(0,1))
names_1881 = pd.read_csv('names1881.csv', header=None, names=['name','gender','count'], index_col=(0,1))
```
As you can see by looking at their shapes, which have been printed in the IPython Shell, the DataFrame corresponding to 1981 births is much larger, reflecting the greater diversity of names in 1981 as compared to 1881. Or job here is to use the DataFrame .reindex() and .dropna() methods to make a DataFrame common_names counting names from 1881 that were still popular in 1981.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Reindex names_1981 with index of names_1881: common_names
common_names = names_1981.reindex(names_1881.index)
# Print shape of common_names
print(common_names.shape)
# Drop rows with null counts: common_names
common_names = common_names.dropna()
# Print shape of new common_names
print(common_names.shape)
```

## Broadcasting in arithmetic formulas
In this exercise, we'll work with weather data pulled from [wunderground.com](https://www.wunderground.com/). The DataFrame weather has been pre-loaded along with pandas as pd. It has 365 rows (observed each day of the year 2013 in Pittsburgh, PA) and 22 columns reflecting different weather measurements each day. We'll subset a collection of columns related to temperature measurements in degrees Fahrenheit, convert them to degrees Celsius, and relabel the columns of the new DataFrame to reflect the change of units. Remember, ordinary arithmetic operators (like +, -, * , and /) broadcast scalar values to conforming DataFrames when combining scalars & DataFrames in arithmetic expressions. Broadcasting also works with pandas Series and NumPy arrays.

```python
# Extract selected columns from weather as new DataFrame: temps_f
temps_f = weather[['Min TemperatureF','Mean TemperatureF','Max TemperatureF']]
# Convert temps_f to celsius: temps_c
temps_c = (temps_f - 32) * 5/9
# Rename 'F' in column names with 'C': temps_c.columns
temps_c.columns = temps_f.columns.str.replace('F', 'C')
# Print first 5 rows of temps_c
print(temps_c.head())
```

## Computing percentage growth of GDP
Our job in this exercise is to compute the yearly percent-change of US GDP ([Gross Domestic Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)) since 2008. The data has been obtained from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP/downloaddata) and is available in the file GDP.csv, which contains quarterly data; we will resample it to annual sampling and then compute the annual growth of GDP. For a refresher on resampling, check out the relevant material from [pandas Foundations](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations/time-series-in-pandas?ex=7).

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read 'GDP.csv' into a DataFrame: gdp
gdp = pd.read_csv('GDP.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col='DATE')
# Slice all the gdp data from 2008 onward: post2008
post2008 = gdp.loc['2008':]
# Print the last 8 rows of post2008
print(post2008.tail(8))
# Resample post2008 by year, keeping last(): yearly
yearly = post2008.resample('A').last()
# Print yearly
print(yearly)
# Compute percentage growth of yearly: yearly['growth']
yearly['growth'] = yearly.pct_change() *100
# Print yearly again
print(yearly)
```

## Converting currency of stocks
In this exercise, stock prices in US Dollars for the S&P 500 in 2015 have been obtained from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). The files sp500.csv for sp500 and exchange.csv for the exchange rates are both provided to us. Using the daily exchange rate to Pounds Sterling, your task is to convert both the Open and Close column prices.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Read 'sp500.csv' into a DataFrame: sp500
sp500 = pd.read_csv('sp500.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col='Date')
# Read 'exchange.csv' into a DataFrame: exchange
exchange =  pd.read_csv('exchange.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col='Date')
# Subset 'Open' & 'Close' columns from sp500: dollars
dollars = sp500[['Open','Close']]
# Print the head of dollars
print(dollars.head())
# Convert dollars to pounds: pounds
pounds = dollars.multiply(exchange['GBP/USD'], axis='rows')
# Print the head of pounds
print(pounds.head())
```

## Appending pandas Series
In this exercise, we'll load sales data from the months January, February, and March into DataFrames. Then, we'll extract Series with the 'Units' column from each and append them together with method chaining using .append(). To check that the stacking worked, we'll print slices from these Series, and finally, we'll add the result to figure out the total units sold in the first quarter.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Load 'sales-jan-2015.csv' into a DataFrame: jan
jan = pd.read_csv('sales-jan-2015.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col='Date')
# Load 'sales-feb-2015.csv' into a DataFrame: feb
feb = pd.read_csv('sales-feb-2015.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col='Date')
# Load 'sales-mar-2015.csv' into a DataFrame: mar
mar = pd.read_csv('sales-mar-2015.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col='Date')
# Extract the 'Units' column from jan: jan_units
jan_units = jan['Units']
# Extract the 'Units' column from feb: feb_units
feb_units = feb['Units']
# Extract the 'Units' column from mar: mar_units
mar_units = mar['Units']
# Append feb_units and then mar_units to jan_units: quarter1
quarter1 = jan_units.append(feb_units).append(mar_units)
# Print the first slice from quarter1
print(quarter1.loc['jan 27, 2015':'feb 2, 2015'])
# Print the second slice from quarter1
print(quarter1.loc['feb 26, 2015':'mar 7, 2015'])
# Compute & print total sales in quarter1
print(quarter1.sum())
```

## Concatenating pandas Series along row axis
Having learned how to append Series, we'll now learn how to achieve the same result by concatenating Series instead. We'll continue to work with the sales data we've seen previously. Our job is to use pd.concat() with a list of Series to achieve the same result that you would get by chaining calls to .append(). You may be wondering about the difference between pd.concat() and pandas' .append() method. One way to think of the difference is that .append() is a specific case of a concatenation, while pd.concat() gives us more flexibility, as we'll see later.

```python
# Initialize empty list: units
units = []
# Build the list of Series
for month in [jan, feb, mar]:
    units.append(month['Units'])
# Concatenate the list: quarter1
quarter1 = pd.concat(units, axis='rows')
# Print slices from quarter1
print(quarter1.loc['jan 27, 2015':'feb 2, 2015'])
print(quarter1.loc['feb 26, 2015':'mar 7, 2015'])
```
