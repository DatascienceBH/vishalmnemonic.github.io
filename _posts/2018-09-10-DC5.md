## Importing entire text files
We'll be working with the file moby_dick.txt. It is a text file that contains the opening sentences of Moby Dick, one of the great American novels! Here we'll get experience opening a text file, printing its contents to the shell and, finally, closing it.

```python
# Open a file: file
file = open('moby_dick.txt', mode='r')
# Print it
print(file.read())
# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed)
# Close file
file.close()
# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed)
```

## Importing text files line by line
For large files, we may not want to print all of their content to the shell: we may wish to print only the first few lines. Enter the readline() method, which allows you to do this. When a file called file is open, we can print out the first line by executing file.readline(). If we execute the same command again, the second line will print, and so on. We can bind a variable file by using a context manager construct. While still within this construct, the variable file will be bound to open('huck_finn.txt'); thus, to print the file to the shell, all the code we need to execute is:
```python
# Read & print the first 3 lines
with open('moby_dick.txt') as file:
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
```

## Using NumPy to import flat files
We are now going to load the MNIST digit recognition dataset using the numpy function loadtxt(). The first argument will be the filename. The second will be the delimiter which, in this case, is a comma. You can find more information about the MNIST dataset [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) on the webpage of Yann LeCun, who is currently Director of AI Research at Facebook and Founding Director of the NYU Center for Data Science, among many other things.

```python
# Import package
import numpy as np
# Assign filename to variable: file
file = 'digits.csv'
# Load file as array: digits
digits = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=",")
# Print datatype of digits
print(type(digits))
# Select and reshape a row
im = digits[21, 1:]
im_sq = np.reshape(im, (28, 28))
# Plot reshaped data (matplotlib.pyplot already loaded as plt)
plt.imshow(im_sq, cmap='Greys', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()
```

What if there are rows, such as a header, that we don't want to import? What if our file has a delimiter other than a comma? What if we only wish to import particular columns? There are a number of arguments that np.loadtxt() takes that we'll find useful: delimiter changes the delimiter that loadtxt() is expecting, for example, we can use ',' and '\t' for comma-delimited and tab-delimited respectively; skiprows allows us to specify how many rows (not indices) we wish to skip; usecols takes a list of the indices of the columns we wish to keep. The file that we'll be importing, digits_header.txt, has a header and is tab-delimited.

```python
# Import numpy
import numpy as np
# Assign the filename: file
file = 'digits_header.txt'
# Load the data: data
data = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter="\t", skiprows=1, usecols=[0,2])
# Print data
print(data)
```

The file seaslug.txt has a text header, consisting of strings and is tab-delimited. These data consists of percentage of sea slug larvae that had metamorphosed in a given time period. Read more [here](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/seaslug-explanation.html). Due to the header, if we try to import it as-is using np.loadtxt(), Python would throw us a ValueError and tell us that it could not convert string to float. There are two ways to deal with this: firstly, we can set the data type argument dtype equal to str (for string). Alternatively, we can skip the first row as we have seen before, using the skiprows argument.

```python
# Assign filename: file
file = 'seaslug.txt'
# Import file: data
data = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter='\t', dtype=str)
# Print the first element of data
print(data[0])
# Import data as floats and skip the first row: data_float
data_float = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter="\t", dtype=float, skiprows=1)
# Print the 10th element of data_float
print(data_float[9])
# Plot a scatterplot of the data
plt.scatter(data_float[:, 0], data_float[:, 1])
plt.xlabel('time (min.)')
plt.ylabel('percentage of larvae')
plt.show()
```

Much of the time we will need to import datasets which have different datatypes in different columns; one column may contain strings and another floats, for example. The function np.loadtxt() will freak at this. There is another function, np.genfromtxt(), which can handle such structures. If we pass dtype=None to it, it will figure out what types each column should be. There is also another function np.recfromcsv() that behaves similarly to np.genfromtxt(), except that its default dtype is None.

```python
# Assign the filename: file
file = 'titanic.csv'
# Import file using np.recfromcsv: d
d=np.recfromcsv(file,delimiter=',',names=True,dtype=None)
# Print out first three entries of d
print(d[:3])
```
