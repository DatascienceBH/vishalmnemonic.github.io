## Importing entire text files
We'll be working with the file moby_dick.txt. It is a text file that contains the opening sentences of Moby Dick, one of the great American novels! Here we'll get experience opening a text file, printing its contents to the shell and, finally, closing it.

```python
# Open a file: file
file = open('moby_dick.txt', mode='r')
# Print it
print(file.read())
# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed)
# Close file
file.close()
# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed)
```

## Importing text files line by line
For large files, we may not want to print all of their content to the shell: we may wish to print only the first few lines. Enter the readline() method, which allows you to do this. When a file called file is open, we can print out the first line by executing file.readline(). If we execute the same command again, the second line will print, and so on. We can bind a variable file by using a context manager construct. While still within this construct, the variable file will be bound to open('huck_finn.txt'); thus, to print the file to the shell, all the code we need to execute is:
```python
# Read & print the first 3 lines
with open('moby_dick.txt') as file:
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
```
