# Python as a calculator

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

Exponentiation: **
This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.
Modulo: %
This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.
The code in the script on the right gives some examples.

## Addition and subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

## Multiplication and division
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)

## Exponentiation
print(4 ** 2)
