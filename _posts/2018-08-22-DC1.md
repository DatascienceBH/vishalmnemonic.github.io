## Python as a calculator

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as exponentiation and modulo.

The code in the script on the right gives some examples.

```python
print(5 + 5)      # Addition
print(5 - 5)      # Subtraction
print(3 * 5)      # Multiplication
print(10 / 2)     # Division
print(4 ** 2)     # Exponentiation
```

## Variable Assignment
In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. Remember, = in Python means assignment, it doesn't test equality!. To create a variable use =, like this example:
```python
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100
# Print out savings
print(savings)
# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10
# Calculate result
result = savings * (factor**7)
# Print out result
print(result)
```
