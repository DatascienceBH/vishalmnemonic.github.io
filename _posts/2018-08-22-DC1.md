# Python as a calculator

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as exponentiation and modulo.

The code in the script on the right gives some examples.

```python
print(5 + 5)      # Addition
print(5 - 5)      # Subtraction
print(3 * 5)      # Multiplication
print(10 / 2)     # Division
print(4 ** 2)     # Exponentiation
```
