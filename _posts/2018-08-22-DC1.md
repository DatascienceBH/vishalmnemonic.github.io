## Python as a calculator

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as exponentiation and modulo.
The code in the script on the right gives some examples.

```python
print(5 + 5)      # Addition
print(5 - 5)      # Subtraction
print(3 * 5)      # Multiplication
print(10 / 2)     # Division
print(4 ** 2)     # Exponentiation
```

## Variable Assignment

In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. Remember, = in Python means assignment, it doesn't test equality!. To create a variable use =, like this example:
```python
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100
# Print out savings
print(savings)
# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10
# Calculate result
result = savings * (factor**7)
# Print out result
print(result)
```

## Other variable types

In the previous example, you worked with two Python data types:
1. int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. e.g. 100.
2. float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. e.g. 10.1.

Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:
3. str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
4. bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).

```python
# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"
# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True
```

## Operations with other types
Different types behave differently in Python. When you sum two strings, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans. In the script some variables with different types have already been created. It's up to you to use them.

```python
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"
# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = savings * factor
# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))
# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc
# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)
```
