## Python as a Calculator

Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as exponentiation and modulo.
The code in the script on the right gives some examples.

```python
print(5 + 5)      # Addition
print(5 - 5)      # Subtraction
print(3 * 5)      # Multiplication
print(10 / 2)     # Division
print(4 ** 2)     # Exponentiation
```

## Variable Assignment

In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. Remember, = in Python means assignment, it doesn't test equality!. To create a variable use =, like this example:
```python
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100
# Print out savings
print(savings)
# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10
# Calculate result
result = savings * (factor**7)
# Print out result
print(result)
```

## Other Variable Types

In the previous example, you worked with two Python data types:
1. int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. e.g. 100.
2. float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. e.g. 10.1.

Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:
1. str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
2. bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).

```python
# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"
# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True
```

## Operations with Other Types

Different types behave differently in Python. When you sum two strings, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans. In the script some variables with different types have already been created. It's up to you to use them.

```python
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"
# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = savings * factor
# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))
# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc
# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)
```

## Type Conversion

Using the + operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages. Suppose, for example, that you've calculated the return of your investment and want to summarize the results in a string.

print("I started with $" + savings + " and now have $" + result + ". Awesome!")

This will not work, though, as you cannot simply sum strings and floats. To fix the error, you'll need to explicitly convert the types of your variables. More specifically, you'll need str(), to convert a value into a string. Similar functions such as int(), float() and bool() will help you convert Python values into any type.

```python
# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7
# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")
# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"
# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)
```

## Create a list

As opposed to int, bool etc., a list is a compound data type. After measuring the height of your family, you decide to collect some information on the house you're living in. The areas of the different parts of your house are stored in separate variables for now, as shown in the script.

```python
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50
# Create list areas
areas= [hall, kit, liv, bed, bath]
print(areas)
```

### Create List with Different Types
A list can contain any Python type. Although it's not really common, a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, booleans, etc. The printout of the previous exercise wasn't really satisfying. It's just a list of numbers representing the areas, but you can't tell which area corresponds to which part of your house.

The code below is the start of a solution. For some of the areas, the name of the corresponding room is already placed in front. Pay attention here! "bathroom" is a string, while bath is a variable that represents the float 9.50 you specified earlier.

```python
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50
# Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway", hall, "kitchen", kit, "living room", liv, "bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]
print(areas)
```

### List of Lists
As a data scientist, you'll often be dealing with a lot of data, and it will make sense to group some of this data. Instead of creating a flat list containing strings and floats, representing the names and areas of the rooms in your house, you can create a list of lists. The script below can already give you an idea.
Don't get confused here: "hallway" is a string, while hall is a variable that represents the float 11.25 you specified earlier.

```python
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50
# house information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom",bed],
         ["bathroom", bath]]
# Print out house
print(house)
# Print out the type of house
print(type(house))
```

### Subset and Conquer
Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list x and then selects "b" from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.

```python
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1]
x[-3] # same result!
```

Remember the areas list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?

```python
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
# Print out second element from areas
print(areas[1])
# Print out last element from areas
print(areas[-1])
# Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[5])
```

### Subset and Calculate
After you've extracted values from a list, you can use them to perform additional calculations. Take this example, where the second and fourth element of a list x are extracted. The strings that result are pasted together using the + operator:

```python
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
print(x[1] + x[3])
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
# Sum of kitchen and bedroom area: eat_sleep_area
eat_sleep_area = areas[3]+areas[7]
# Print the variable eat_sleep_area
print(eat_sleep_area)
```

### Slicing and Dicing
Selecting single values from a list is just one part of the story. It's also possible to slice your list, which means selecting multiple elements from your list. Use the following syntax:

```python
my_list[start:end]
my_list[including, excluding]

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
# Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs=areas[0:6]
# Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs= areas[-4:]
# Print out downstairs and upstairs
print(downstairs)
print(upstairs)
```


It's also possible not to specify these indexes. If you don't specify the begin index, Python figures out that you want to start your slice at the beginning of your list. If you don't specify the end index, the slice will go all the way to the last element of your list.

```python
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
# Alternative slicing to create downstairs
downstairs=areas[:6]
# Alternative slicing to create upstairs
upstairs=areas[-4:]
```


## Replace list elements
Replacing list elements is pretty easy. Simply subset the list and assign new values to the subset. You can select single elements or you can change entire list slices at once.

```python
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
# Correct the bathroom area
areas[9]= 10.50
# Change "living room" to "chill zone"
areas[4]= "chill zone"
```

### Extend a list
If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the + operator:

```python
# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]
# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1= areas+ ["poolhouse", 24.5]
# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas_1 + ["garage",15.45]
```

### Inner workings of lists

The Python code in the script already creates a list with the name areas and a copy named areas_copy. Next, the first element in the areas_copy list is changed and the areas list is printed out. If you hit Run Code you'll see that, although you've changed areas_copy, the change also takes effect in the areas list. That's because areas and areas_copy point to the same list. If you want to prevent changes in areas_copy from also taking effect in areas, you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the areas list. You can do this with list() or by using [:].

```python
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]
# Create areas_copy
areas_copy = list(areas)
# Change areas_copy
areas_copy[0] = 5.0
# Print areas
print(areas)
```
