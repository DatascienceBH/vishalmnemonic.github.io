## Plotting a histogram of iris data
We will use a classic data set collected by botanist Edward Anderson and made famous by Ronald Fisher, one of the most prolific statisticians in history. Anderson carefully measured the anatomical properties of samples of three different species of iris, Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The full data set is [available as part of scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html). Here, we will work with his measurements of petal length.

Plot a histogram of the petal lengths of his 50 samples of Iris versicolor using matplotlib/seaborn's default settings. Recall that to specify the default seaborn style, we can use sns.set(), where sns is the alias that seaborn is imported as. The subset of the data set containing the Iris versicolor petal lengths in units of centimeters (cm) is stored in the NumPy array versicolor_petal_length. If you are working in an interactive environment such as a Jupyter notebook, you could use a ; to prevent unnecessary output from being displayed after your plotting statements.

```python
# Import plotting modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
# Set default Seaborn style
sns.set()
# Plot histogram of versicolor petal lengths
_ = plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length)
# Show histogram
plt.show()
```

## Axis labels!
In the last exercise, we made a nice histogram of petal lengths of Iris versicolor, but we didn't label the axes! That's ok; it's not your fault since we didn't ask you to. Now, add axis labels to the plot using plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel(). Don't forget to add units and assign both statements to _ .

```python
# Plot histogram of versicolor petal lengths
_ = plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length)
# Label axes
_= plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_= plt.ylabel('count')
# Show histogram
plt.show()
```

## Adjusting the number of bins in a histogram
The histogram we just made had ten bins. This is the default of matplotlib. The "square root rule" is a commonly-used rule of thumb for choosing number of bins: choose the number of bins to be the square root of the number of samples. Plot the histogram of Iris versicolor petal lengths again, this time using the square root rule for the number of bins. We specify the number of bins using the bins keyword argument of plt.hist().

```python
# Import numpy
import numpy as np
# Compute number of data points: n_data
n_data= len(versicolor_petal_length)
# Number of bins is the square root of number of data points: n_bins
n_bins= np.sqrt(n_data)
# Convert number of bins to integer: n_bins
n_bins = int(n_bins)
# Plot the histogram
_=plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length,bins=n_bins)
# Label axes
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('count')
# Show histogram
plt.show()
```

## Bee swarm plot
Make a bee swarm plot of the iris petal lengths. Our x-axis should contain each of the three species, and the y-axis the petal lengths. A data frame containing the data is in our namespace as df.

```python
# Create bee swarm plot with Seaborn's default settings
_= sns.swarmplot(x= 'species' ,y='petal length (cm)' ,data= df)
# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('species')
_ = plt.ylabel('petal length (cm)')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Computing the ECDF
We will write a function that takes as input a 1D array of data and then returns the x and y values of the ECDF. We will use this function over and over again throughout this course and its sequel. ECDFs are among the most important plots in statistical analysis. We can write your own function, foo(x,y) according to the following skeleton:
```
def foo(a,b):
    """State what function does here"""
    # Computation performed here
    return x, y
```
The function foo() above takes two arguments a and b and returns two values x and y. The function header def foo(a,b): contains the function signature foo(a,b), which consists of the function name, along with its parameters.

```python
def ecdf(data):
    """Compute ECDF for a one-dimensional array of measurements."""
    # Number of data points: n
    n=len(data)
    # x-data for the ECDF: x
    x=np.sort(data)
    # y-data for the ECDF: y
    y = np.arange(1,n+1) / n
    return x, y
```

## Plotting the ECDF
We will now use your ecdf() function to compute the ECDF for the petal lengths of Anderson's Iris versicolor flowers. We will then plot the ECDF. Recall that our ecdf() function returns two arrays so we will need to unpack them. An example of such unpacking is x, y = foo(data), for some function foo().

```python
# Compute ECDF for versicolor data: x_vers, y_vers
x_vers,y_vers = ecdf(versicolor_petal_length)
# Generate plot
plt.plot(x_vers,y_vers,marker='.',linestyle='none')
# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('versicolor_petal_length')
plt.ylabel('ECDF')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## Comparison of ECDFs
ECDFs also allow us to compare two or more distributions (though plots get cluttered if we have too many). Here, we will plot ECDFs for the petal lengths of all three iris species. We already wrote a function to generate ECDFs so you can put it to good use! To overlay all three ECDFs on the same plot, we can use plt.plot() three times, once for each ECDF. Remember to include marker='.' and linestyle='none' as arguments inside plt.plot().

```python
# Compute ECDFs
x_set,y_set=ecdf(setosa_petal_length)
x_vers,y_vers=ecdf(versicolor_petal_length)
x_virg, y_virg=ecdf(virginica_petal_length)
# Plot all ECDFs on the same plot
_=plt.plot(x_set,y_set,marker='.',linestyle='none')
_=plt.plot(x_vers,y_vers,marker='.',linestyle='none')
_=plt.plot(x_virg,y_virg,marker='.',linestyle='none')
# Annotate the plot
plt.legend(('setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'), loc='lower right')
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## Computing means
The mean of all measurements gives an indication of the typical magnitude of a measurement. It is computed using np.mean().

```python
# Compute the mean: mean_length_vers
mean_length_vers=np.mean(versicolor_petal_length)
# Print the result with some nice formatting
print('I. versicolor:', mean_length_vers, 'cm')
```

## Computing percentiles
In this exercise, we will compute the percentiles of petal length of Iris versicolor.

```python
# Specify array of percentiles: percentiles
percentiles=np.array([2.5,25,50,75,97.5])
# Compute percentiles: ptiles_vers
ptiles_vers=np.percentile(versicolor_petal_length,percentiles)
# Print the result
print(ptiles_vers)
```

## Comparing percentiles to ECDF
To see how the percentiles relate to the ECDF, we will plot the percentiles of Iris versicolor petal lengths we calculated in the last exercise on the ECDF plot. The percentile variables from the previous exercise are available in the workspace as ptiles_vers and percentiles. Note that to ensure the Y-axis of the ECDF plot remains between 0 and 1, we will need to rescale the percentiles array accordingly - in this case, dividing it by 100.

```python
# Plot the ECDF
_ = plt.plot(x_vers, y_vers, '.')
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
# Overlay percentiles as red diamonds.
_ = plt.plot(ptiles_vers, percentiles/100, marker='D', color='red',
         linestyle='none')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Box-and-whisker plot
Making a box plot for the petal lengths is unnecessary because the iris data set is not too large and the bee swarm plot works fine. However, it is always good to get some practice. Make a box plot of the iris petal lengths. We have a pandas DataFrame, df, which contains the petal length data. Inspect the data frame df in the IPython shell using df.head() to make sure you know what the pertinent columns are.

```python
# Create box plot with Seaborn's default settings
_ = sns.boxplot(x='species', y='petal length (cm)', data=df)
# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('species')
_ = plt.ylabel('petal length (cm)')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Computing the variance
It is important to have some understanding of what commonly-used functions are doing under the hood. Though we may already know how to compute variances, this is a beginner course that does not assume so. In this exercise, we will explicitly compute the variance of the petal length of Iris veriscolor using the equations discussed in the videos. We will then use np.var() to compute it.

```python
# Array of differences to mean: differences
differences=versicolor_petal_length-np.mean(versicolor_petal_length)
# Square the differences: diff_sq
diff_sq=differences**2
# Compute the mean square difference: variance_explicit
variance_explicit=np.mean(diff_sq)
# Compute the variance using NumPy: variance_np
variance_np=np.var(versicolor_petal_length)
# Print the results
print(variance_explicit,variance_np)
```

## The standard deviation and the variance
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. We will see this for yourself by computing the standard deviation using np.std() and comparing it to what we get by computing the variance with np.var() and then computing the square root.

```python
# Compute the variance: variance
variance=np.var(versicolor_petal_length)
# Print the square root of the variance
print(np.sqrt(variance))
# Print the standard deviation
print(np.std(versicolor_petal_length))
```

## Scatter plots
When we made bee swarm plots, box plots, and ECDF plots in previous exercises, we compared the petal lengths of different species of iris. But what if we want to compare two properties of a single species? This is exactly what we will do in this exercise. We will make a scatter plot of the petal length and width measurements of Anderson's Iris versicolor flowers. If the flower scales (that is, it preserves its proportion as it grows), we would expect the length and width to be correlated.

```python
# Make a scatter plot
_ = plt.plot(versicolor_petal_length, versicolor_petal_width, marker='.', linestyle='none')
# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('versicolor petal length')
_ = plt.ylabel('versicolor petal width')
# Show the result
plt.show()
```

## Computing the covariance
The covariance may be computed using the Numpy function np.cov(). For example, we have two sets of data x and y, np.cov(x, y) returns a 2D array where entries [0,1] and [1,0] are the covariances. Entry [0,0] is the variance of the data in x, and entry [1,1] is the variance of the data in y. This 2D output array is called the covariance matrix, since it organizes the self- and covariance.

```python
# Compute the covariance matrix: covariance_matrix
covariance_matrix=np.cov(versicolor_petal_length,versicolor_petal_width)
# Print covariance matrix
print(covariance_matrix)
# Extract covariance of length and width of petals: petal_cov
petal_cov=covariance_matrix[0,1]
# Print the length/width covariance
print(petal_cov)
```

## Computing the Pearson correlation coefficient
The Pearson correlation coefficient, also called the Pearson r, is often easier to interpret than the covariance. It is computed using the np.corrcoef() function. Like np.cov(), it takes two arrays as arguments and returns a 2D array. Entries [0,0] and [1,1] are necessarily equal to 1 (can you think about why?), and the value we are after is entry [0,1]. We will write a function, pearson_r(x, y) that takes in two arrays and returns the Pearson correlation coefficient. We will then use this function to compute it for the petal lengths and widths of I. versicolor.

```python
def pearson_r(x, y):
    """Compute Pearson correlation coefficient between two arrays."""
    # Compute correlation matrix: corr_mat
    corr_mat=np.corrcoef(x,y)
    # Return entry [0,1]
    return corr_mat[0,1]
# Compute Pearson correlation coefficient for I. versicolor: r
r=pearson_r(versicolor_petal_length,versicolor_petal_width)
# Print the result
print(r)
```
