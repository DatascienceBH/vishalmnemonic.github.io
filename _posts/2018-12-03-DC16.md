## XGBoost: Fit/Predict
It's time to create our first XGBoost model! We can use the scikit-learn .fit() / .predict() paradigm that we are already familiar to build your XGBoost models, as the xgboost library has a scikit-learn compatible API! Here, we'll be working with churn data. This dataset contains imaginary data from a ride-sharing app with user behaviors over their first month of app usage in a set of imaginary cities as well as whether they used the service 5 months after sign-up.

Our goal is to use the first month's worth of data to predict whether the app's users will remain users of the service at the 5 month mark. This is a typical setup for a churn prediction problem. To do this, we'll split the data into training and test sets, fit a small xgboost model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set by computing its accuracy.

pandas and numpy have been imported as pd and np, and train_test_split has been imported from sklearn.model_selection. Additionally, the arrays for the features and the target have been created as X and y.

```python
#import xgboost
import xgboost as xgb
# Create arrays for the features and the target: X, y
X, y = churn_data.iloc[:,:-1], churn_data.iloc[:,-1]
# Create the training and test sets
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test= train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
# Instantiate the XGBClassifier: xg_cl
xg_cl = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective='binary:logistic', n_estimators=10, seed=123)
# Fit the classifier to the training set
xg_cl.fit(X_train,y_train)
# Predict the labels of the test set: preds
preds = xg_cl.predict(X_test)
# Compute the accuracy: accuracy
accuracy = float(np.sum(preds==y_test))/y_test.shape[0]
print("accuracy: %f" % (accuracy))
```

## Decision trees
Our task in this exercise is to make a simple decision tree using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier on the breast cancer dataset that comes pre-loaded with scikit-learn. This dataset contains numeric measurements of various dimensions of individual tumors (such as perimeter and texture) from breast biopsies and a single outcome value (the tumor is either malignant, or benign). We've preloaded the dataset of samples (measurements) into X and the target values per tumor into y. Now, you have to split the complete dataset into training and testing sets, and then train a DecisionTreeClassifier. You'll specify a parameter called max_depth. Many other parameters can be modified within this model, and we can check all of them out [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier).

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
# Create the training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
# Instantiate the classifier: dt_clf_4
dt_clf_4 = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4)
# Fit the classifier to the training set
dt_clf_4.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Predict the labels of the test set: y_pred_4
y_pred_4 = dt_clf_4.predict(X_test)
# Compute the accuracy of the predictions: accuracy
accuracy = float(np.sum(y_pred_4==y_test))/y_test.shape[0]
print("accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## Measuring accuracy
We'll now practice using XGBoost's learning API through its baked in cross-validation capabilities. XGBoost gets its lauded performance and efficiency gains by utilizing its own optimized data structure for datasets called a DMatrix. In the previous exercise, the input datasets were converted into DMatrix data on the fly, but when we use the xgboost cv object, we have to first explicitly convert your data into a DMatrix. So, that's what we will do here before running cross-validation on churn_data.

```python
# Create the DMatrix: churn_dmatrix
churn_dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(data=churn_data.iloc[:,:-1], label=churn_data.iloc[:,-1])
# Create the parameter dictionary: params
params = {"objective":"reg:logistic", "max_depth":3}
# Perform cross-validation: cv_results
cv_results = xgb.cv(dtrain=churn_dmatrix, params=params, nfold=3, num_boost_round=5, metrics="error", as_pandas=True, seed=123)
# Print cv_results
print(cv_results)
# Print the accuracy
print(((1-cv_results["test-error-mean"]).iloc[-1]))
```

## Measuring AUC
Now that we've used cross-validation to compute average out-of-sample accuracy (after converting from an error), it's very easy to compute any other metric you might be interested in. All we have to do is pass it (or a list of metrics) in as an argument to the metrics parameter of xgb.cv(). Our job in this exercise is to compute another common metric used in binary classification - the area under the curve ("auc").

```python
# Perform cross_validation: cv_results
cv_results = xgb.cv(dtrain=churn_dmatrix, params=params, nfold=3, num_boost_round=5, metrics="auc", as_pandas=True, seed=123)
# Print cv_results
print(cv_results)
# Print the AUC
print((cv_results["test-auc-mean"]).iloc[-1])
```

## Decision trees as base learners
It's now time to build an XGBoost model to predict house prices - not in Boston, Massachusetts, but in Ames, Iowa! This dataset of housing prices has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called df. If we explore it in the Shell, we'll see that there are a variety of features about the house and its location in the city. Our goal is to use trees as base learners. By default, XGBoost uses trees as base learners, so we don't have to specify that you want to use trees here with booster="gbtree". xgboost has been imported as xgb and the arrays for the features and the target are available in X and y, respectively.

```python
# Create the training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size= 0.2, random_state=123)
# Instantiate the XGBRegressor: xg_reg
xg_reg = xgb.XGBRegressor(objective='reg:linear', n_estimators=10, seed=123)
# Fit the regressor to the training set
xg_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Predict the labels of the test set: preds
preds = xg_reg.predict(X_test)
# Compute the rmse: rmse
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, preds))
print("RMSE: %f" % (rmse))
```
