## Iterating over iterables
An iterable is an object that can return an iterator, while an iterator is an object that keeps state and produces the next value when you call next() on it. You will reinforce your knowledge about these by iterating over and printing from iterables and iterators.

```python
# Create a list of strings: flash
flash = ['jay garrick', 'barry allen', 'wally west', 'bart allen']
# Print each list item in flash using a for loop
for person in flash:
    print(person)
# Create an iterator for flash: superspeed
superspeed=iter(flash)
# Print each item from the iterator
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))
```

Note that not all iterables are actual lists. They can be strings. Now we will focus on the range() function. You can use range() in a for loop as if it's a list to be iterated over. Recall that range() doesn't actually create the list; instead, it creates a range object with an iterator that produces the values until it reaches the limit. If range() created the actual list, calling it with a value of 10100 may not work, especially since a number as big as that may go over a regular computer's memory. The value 10100 is actually what's called a Googol which is a 1 followed by a hundred 0s. That's a huge number!

```python
# Create an iterator for range(3): small_value
small_value = iter(range(3))
# Print the values in small_value
print(next(small_value))
print(next(small_value))
print(next(small_value))
# Loop over range(3) and print the values
for num in range(3):
  print(num)
# Create an iterator for range(10 ** 100): googol
googol = iter(range(10 ** 100))
# Print the first 5 values from googol
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
```

### Iterators as function arguments
We've been using the iter() function to get an iterator object, as well as the next() function to retrieve the values one by one from the iterator object. There are also functions that take iterators as arguments. For example, the list() and sum() functions return a list and the sum of elements, respectively.

```python
# Create a range object: values
values = range(10,21)
# Print the range object
print(values)
# Create a list of integers: values_list
values_list = list(values)
# Print values_list
print(values_list)
# Get the sum of values: values_sum
values_sum = sum(values)
# Print values_sum
print(values_sum)
```

## Using enumerate
We've just gained several new ideas on iterators and one of them is the enumerate() function. Recall that enumerate() returns an enumerate object that produces a sequence of tuples, and each of the tuples is an index-value pair.

```python
# Create a list of strings: mutants
mutants = ['charles xavier',
            'bobby drake',
            'kurt wagner',
            'max eisenhardt',
            'kitty pride']
# Create a list of tuples: mutant_list
mutant_list = list(enumerate(mutants))
# Print the list of tuples
print(mutant_list)
# Unpack and print the tuple pairs
for index1,value1 in enumerate(mutants):
    print(index1, value1)
# Change the start index
for index2,value2 in enumerate(mutants,start=1):
    print(index2, value2)
```

## Using zip
Another interesting function is zip(), which takes any number of iterables and returns a zip object that is an iterator of tuples. If you wanted to print the values of a zip object, you can convert it into a list and then print it. Printing just a zip object will not return the values unless you unpack it first. In this exercise, you will explore this for yourself.

```python
# Create a list of tuples: mutant_data
mutant_data = list(zip(mutants,aliases,powers))
# Print the list of tuples
print(mutant_data)
# Create a zip object using the three lists: mutant_zip
mutant_zip = zip(mutants,aliases,powers)
# Print the zip object
print(mutant_zip)
# Unpack the zip object and print the tuple values
for value1,value2,value3 in mutant_zip:
    print(value1, value2, value3)
```

## Using * and zip to 'unzip'
We know how to use zip() as well as how to print out values from a zip object. Excellent! Let's play around with zip() a little more. There is no unzip function for doing the reverse of what zip() does. We can, however, reverse what has been zipped together by using zip() with a little help from * ! * unpacks an iterable such as a list or a tuple into positional arguments in a function call.

```python
# Create a zip object from mutants and powers: z1
z1 = zip(mutants,powers)
# Print the tuples in z1 by unpacking with *
print(*z1)
# Re-create a zip object from mutants and powers: z1
z1 = zip(mutants,powers)
# 'Unzip' the tuples in z1 by unpacking with * and zip(): result1, result2
result1, result2 = zip(*z1)
# Check if unpacked tuples are equivalent to original tuples
print(result1 == mutants)
print(result2 == powers)
```

## Processing large amounts of Twitter data
Sometimes, the data we have to process reaches a size that is too much for a computer's memory to handle. This is a common problem faced by data scientists. A solution to this is to process an entire data source chunk by chunk, instead of a single go all at once. We will process a large csv file of Twitter data in the same way that you processed 'tweets.csv' in Bringing it all together exercises of the prequel course, but this time, working on it in chunks of 10 entries at a time.

```python
# Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
counts_dict={}
# Iterate over the file chunk by chunk
for chunk in pd.read_csv('tweets.csv',chunksize=10):
    # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
    for entry in chunk['lang']:
        if entry in counts_dict.keys():
            counts_dict[entry] += 1
        else:
            counts_dict[entry] = 1
# Print the populated dictionary
print(counts_dict)
```

We now know how to deal with situations where you need to process a very large file and that's a very useful skill to have! It's good to know how to process a file in smaller, more manageable chunks, but it can become very tedious having to write and rewrite the same code for the same task each time.

```python
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(csv_file,c_size,colname):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""
    # Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
    counts_dict = {}
    # Iterate over the file chunk by chunk
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(csv_file,chunksize=c_size):
        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
        for entry in chunk[colname]:
            if entry in counts_dict.keys():
                counts_dict[entry] += 1
            else:
                counts_dict[entry] = 1
    # Return counts_dict
    return counts_dict
# Call count_entries(): result_counts
result_counts = count_entries('tweets.csv',10,'lang')
# Print result_counts
print(result_counts)
```

## Writing list comprehensions
List comprehensions can be built over iterables. They can replace a for loop in  a single line of code. Our job in this exercise is to write a list comprehension that produces a list of the squares of the numbers ranging from 0 to 9.

```python
# Create list comprehension: squares
squares = [ i*i for i in range(0,10)]
```
### Nested list comprehensions
Great! We have a good grasp of the basic syntax of list comprehensions. Let's push our code-writing skills a little further. In this exercise, we will be writing a list comprehension within another list comprehension, or nested list comprehensions. It sounds a little tricky. Let's step aside for a while from strings. One of the ways in which lists can be used are in representing multi-dimension objects such as matrices. Matrices can be represented as a list of lists in Python. For example a 5 x 5 matrix with values 0 to 4 in each row can be written as:

matrix = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]

Our task is to recreate this matrix by using nested listed comprehensions. Recall that we can create one of the rows of the matrix with a single list comprehension. To create the list of lists, we simply have to supply the list comprehension as the output expression of the overall list comprehension:

[[output expression] for iterator variable in iterable]

Note that here, the output expression is itself a list comprehension.

```python
# Create a 5 x 5 matrix using a list of lists: matrix
matrix = [[col for col in range(0,5)] for row in range(0,5)]
# Print the matrix
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

### Using conditionals in comprehensions (1)
We've been using list comprehensions to build lists of values, sometimes using operations to create these values. An interesting mechanism in list comprehensions is that we can also create lists with values that meet only a certain condition. One way of doing this is by using conditionals on iterator variables.

```python
# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']
# Create list comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = [member for member in fellowship if len(member)>=7]
# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)
```

We used an if conditional statement in the predicate expression part of a list comprehension to evaluate an iterator variable. In this exercise, you will use an if-else statement on the output expression of the list.

```python
# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']
# Create list comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = [member if len(member)>=7 else '' for member in fellowship]
# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)
```

### Dict comprehensions
Comprehensions aren't relegated merely to the world of lists. There are many other objects you can build using comprehensions, such as dictionaries, pervasive objects in Data Science. We will create a dictionary using the comprehension syntax for this exercise. In this case, the comprehension is called a dict comprehension. Recall that the main difference between a list comprehension and a dict comprehension is the use of curly braces {} instead of []. Additionally, members of the dictionary are created using a colon :, as in <key> : <value>.

```python
# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']
# Create dict comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = {member:len(member) for member in fellowship}
# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)
```

## Write your own generator expressions
Recall that generator expressions basically have the same syntax as list comprehensions, except that it uses parentheses () instead of brackets []; this should make things feel familiar! Furthermore, if we have ever iterated over a dictionary with .items(), or used the range() function, for example, we have already encountered and used generators before, without knowing it! When we use these functions, Python creates generators for you behind the scenes. Now, we will start simple by creating a generator object that produces numeric values.

```python
# Create generator object: result
result = (num for num in range(31))

# Print the first 5 values
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))

# Print the rest of the values
for value in result:
    print(value)
```

Great! At this point, we already know how to write a basic generator expression. Now we will push this idea a little further by adding to the output expression of a generator expression. Because generator expressions and list comprehensions are so alike in syntax, this should be a familiar task for you!

```python
# Create a list of strings: lannister
lannister = ['cersei', 'jaime', 'tywin', 'tyrion', 'joffrey']

# Create a generator object: lengths
lengths = (len(person) for person in lannister )

# Iterate over and print the values in lengths
for value in lengths:
    print(value)
```

We've dealt mainly with writing generator expressions, which uses comprehension syntax. Being able to use comprehension syntax for generator expressions made your work so much easier! Now, recall there are generator functions as well. Generator functions are functions that, like generator expressions, yield a series of values, instead of returning a single value. A generator function is defined as we do a regular function, but whenever it generates a value, it uses the keyword yield instead of return.

```python
# Create a list of strings
lannister = ['cersei', 'jaime', 'tywin', 'tyrion', 'joffrey']
# Define generator function get_lengths
def get_lengths(input_list):
    """Generator function that yields the
    length of the strings in input_list."""
    # Yield the length of a string
    for person in input_list:
        yield len(person)
# Print the values generated by get_lengths()
for value in get_lengths(lannister):
    print(value)
```
