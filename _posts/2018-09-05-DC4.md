## Iterating over iterables
An iterable is an object that can return an iterator, while an iterator is an object that keeps state and produces the next value when you call next() on it. You will reinforce your knowledge about these by iterating over and printing from iterables and iterators.

```python
# Create a list of strings: flash
flash = ['jay garrick', 'barry allen', 'wally west', 'bart allen']
# Print each list item in flash using a for loop
for person in flash:
    print(person)
# Create an iterator for flash: superspeed
superspeed=iter(flash)
# Print each item from the iterator
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))
```

Note that not all iterables are actual lists. They can be strings. Now we will focus on the range() function. You can use range() in a for loop as if it's a list to be iterated over. Recall that range() doesn't actually create the list; instead, it creates a range object with an iterator that produces the values until it reaches the limit. If range() created the actual list, calling it with a value of 10100 may not work, especially since a number as big as that may go over a regular computer's memory. The value 10100 is actually what's called a Googol which is a 1 followed by a hundred 0s. That's a huge number!

```python
# Create an iterator for range(3): small_value
small_value = iter(range(3))
# Print the values in small_value
print(next(small_value))
print(next(small_value))
print(next(small_value))
# Loop over range(3) and print the values
for num in range(3):
  print(num)
# Create an iterator for range(10 ** 100): googol
googol = iter(range(10 ** 100))
# Print the first 5 values from googol
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
```

### Iterators as function arguments
We've been using the iter() function to get an iterator object, as well as the next() function to retrieve the values one by one from the iterator object. There are also functions that take iterators as arguments. For example, the list() and sum() functions return a list and the sum of elements, respectively.

```python
# Create a range object: values
values = range(10,21)
# Print the range object
print(values)
# Create a list of integers: values_list
values_list = list(values)
# Print values_list
print(values_list)
# Get the sum of values: values_sum
values_sum = sum(values)
# Print values_sum
print(values_sum)
```

## Using enumerate
We've just gained several new ideas on iterators and one of them is the enumerate() function. Recall that enumerate() returns an enumerate object that produces a sequence of tuples, and each of the tuples is an index-value pair.

```python
# Create a list of strings: mutants
mutants = ['charles xavier',
            'bobby drake',
            'kurt wagner',
            'max eisenhardt',
            'kitty pride']
# Create a list of tuples: mutant_list
mutant_list = list(enumerate(mutants))
# Print the list of tuples
print(mutant_list)
# Unpack and print the tuple pairs
for index1,value1 in enumerate(mutants):
    print(index1, value1)
# Change the start index
for index2,value2 in enumerate(mutants,start=1):
    print(index2, value2)
```

## Using zip
Another interesting function is zip(), which takes any number of iterables and returns a zip object that is an iterator of tuples. If you wanted to print the values of a zip object, you can convert it into a list and then print it. Printing just a zip object will not return the values unless you unpack it first. In this exercise, you will explore this for yourself.

```python
# Create a list of tuples: mutant_data
mutant_data = list(zip(mutants,aliases,powers))
# Print the list of tuples
print(mutant_data)
# Create a zip object using the three lists: mutant_zip
mutant_zip = zip(mutants,aliases,powers)
# Print the zip object
print(mutant_zip)
# Unpack the zip object and print the tuple values
for value1,value2,value3 in mutant_zip:
    print(value1, value2, value3)
```

## Using * and zip to 'unzip'
We know how to use zip() as well as how to print out values from a zip object. Excellent! Let's play around with zip() a little more. There is no unzip function for doing the reverse of what zip() does. We can, however, reverse what has been zipped together by using zip() with a little help from * ! * unpacks an iterable such as a list or a tuple into positional arguments in a function call.

```python
# Create a zip object from mutants and powers: z1
z1 = zip(mutants,powers)
# Print the tuples in z1 by unpacking with *
print(*z1)
# Re-create a zip object from mutants and powers: z1
z1 = zip(mutants,powers)
# 'Unzip' the tuples in z1 by unpacking with * and zip(): result1, result2
result1, result2 = zip(*z1)
# Check if unpacked tuples are equivalent to original tuples
print(result1 == mutants)
print(result2 == powers)
```
