## Multiple plots on single axis
It is time now to put together some of what we have learned and combine line plots on a common set of axes. The data set here comes from records of undergraduate degrees awarded to women in a variety of fields from 1970 to 2011. We can compare trends in degrees most easily by viewing two curves on the same set of axes.

Here, three NumPy arrays are available for us: year (enumerating years from 1970 to 2011 inclusive), physical_sciences (representing the percentage of Physical Sciences degrees awarded to women each in corresponding year), and computer_science (representing the percentage of Computer Science degrees awarded to women in each corresponding year).

We will issue two plt.plot() commands to draw line plots of different colors on the same set of axes. Here, year represents the x-axis, while physical_sciences and computer_science are the y-axes.

```python
# Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences , color='blue')
# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science , color='red')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## Using axes()
Rather than overlaying line plots on common axes, we may prefer to plot different line plots on distinct axes. The command plt.axes() is one way to do this (but it requires specifying coordinates relative to the size of the figure).

Here, we have the same three arrays year, physical_sciences, and computer_science representing percentages of degrees awarded to women over a range of years. We will use plt.axes() to create separate sets of axes in which you will draw each line plot.

In calling plt.axes([xlo, ylo, width, height]), a set of axes is created and made active with lower corner at coordinates (xlo, ylo) of the specified width and height. Note that these coordinates can be passed to plt.axes() in the form of a list or a tuple.

The coordinates and lengths are values between 0 and 1 representing lengths relative to the dimensions of the figure. After issuing a plt.axes() command, plots generated are put in that set of axes.

```python
# Create plot axes for the first line plot
plt.axes([0.05, 0.05, 0.425, 0.9])
# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
# Create plot axes for the second line plot
plt.axes([0.525, 0.05, 0.425, 0.9])
# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## Using subplot() (1)
The command plt.axes() requires a lot of effort to use well because the coordinates of the axes need to be set manually. A better alternative is to use plt.subplot() to determine the layout automatically.

In this exercise, we will continue working with the same arrays from the previous exercises: year, physical_sciences, and computer_science. Rather than using plt.axes() to explicitly lay out the axes, we will use plt.subplot(m, n, k) to make the subplot grid of dimensions m by n and to make the kth subplot active (subplots are numbered starting from 1 row-wise from the top left corner of the subplot grid).

```python
# Create a figure with 1x2 subplot and make the left subplot active
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
plt.title('Physical Sciences')
# Make the right subplot active in the current 1x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')
plt.title('Computer Science')
# Use plt.tight_layout() to improve the spacing between subplots
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
